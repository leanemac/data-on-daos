This proposal, if passed, would issue 50,000 GTC for governance rights equating to 1,500,000 $WONDER tokens (1.5% of total supply) when Wonder’s token is live. 

In addition, upon launch, 1% of Wonder’s treasury will be used for QF rounds via Gitcoin Aqueduct 2, to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder.

The purpose of this alliance is to solidify the partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder where we can work together to enable DAOs to succeed.

Motivation

Gitcoin and Wonder are pursuing aligned missions.

Gitcoin’s mission is to build & fund the open web; Wonder is building the necessary tools to facilitate thriving projects on the open web.

Wonder’s task management system allows DAOs to intuitively organize projects, pay contributors with their native token, and onboard new members with ease.

Gitcoin, a DAO of DAOs, benefits from partnership with projects that provide the infrastructure for a nascent DAO ecosystem. Specifically, Wonder can help Gitcoin-funded projects better onboard and retain contributors, improve productivity, and increase visibility within the DAO. In addition, we see this relationship complementing Gitcoin in the following ways:

- Integrations that help Gitcoin source, fund, and scale more public good projects
- Collaboration on job fairs, hackathons, and events for DAOs
- Co-Creating tools to help the Gitcoin DAO operate more efficiently
- Enabling Gitcoin to have a voice in the future direction of Wonder
- Overall, this partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder would likely mark the first of many collaborations with projects in the ‘DAO tooling’ space.

Specification

The passing of this proposal would transfer 50,000 GTC to 0x231F77F0c4D7a9F2E20767c7B76ae745A6c547f9, Wonder’s specified Treasury address.

On the launch of Wonder’s token, 1,500,000 $WONDER would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin’s multisig address.

In addition, upon launch, 1% of Wonder’s treasury will be used for QF rounds via Gitcoin Aqueduct 2, to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder.

Use of Funds

To ensure long term alignment, Wonder will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2024 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.

Benefits

- A long term collaboration between Gitcoin and Wonder
- Integrations of Gitcoin on Wonder’s platform
- 1,500,000 $WONDER tokens
- 1% of $WONDER treasury would flow back into QF PGF mechanisms

Drawbacks

- 50,000 GTC would be removed from the treasury.

For full details, please see our governance post here:
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-the-gitcoin-foundation-a-proposal-to-represent-the-gitcoin-dao-irl-by-a-cayman-islands-foundation/9983/1

Here is the tl;dr:
The community and DAO need a legal entity to own and claim many of the assets currently in possession of Gitcoin Holdings such that we can focus exclusively on growing our mission and philanthropic work.

Next steps:
This vote is the official signal of our communal intent to take formal legal ownership of these assets from Gitcoin Holdings and establish the Gitcoin Foundation as the legal entity that represents us - the DAO, token holders, community members.

Assuming this vote passes, I will begin negotiations with Gitcoin Holdings to procure assets, and bring back those terms of the deal to the community to review. As part of those term negotiations, we will also review and ratify the governing bylaws for the foundation to ensure token holders have near total control of actions taken by the foundation.

An initial draft set of bylaws can be found here, which will be updated as negotiations ensue:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zeSg6piVFNCsYuCSMlwUtiEgnMvHqNsi9oPO6zhlqdU/edit

Call to action:
This vote is to signal we would like to adopt The Gitcoin Foundation and have me represent the community in these negotiations. This vote DOES NOT allow me (or anyone else) to unilaterally accept terms of the negotiation. We will have a second separate vote to ensure the details are discussed and debated.

The proposal is that a pool of GTC is allocated across the Stewards Council for the term. This is to cover gas costs incurred in voting and offer fair allocation for the group as long as they fulfil their functions outlined above. *The sum is for the whole council for the entire term.*

The funds can also be allocated to everyone voting as highlighted by some of the comments on the initial version of the council proposal. This action can be decided on by the council as one of their first joint proposals.

This is a separate Snapshot proposal to determine allocation aside from vote on the creation, members and mandate of the council. Based on the comments on the initial post, an overall agreement was option A. 5,000 GTC for the whole council for the whole mandate. I do want to include all 3 options in this Snapshot for broader agreement.

A. 5,000 GTC
B. 10,000 GTC
C. 15,000 GTC

This proposal seeks to elect the members of the GD Steward Council, approve its mandate and tenure. We currently have 14 stewards elligible for a seat on the council. 

A separate snapshot will go up for Council GTC allocation. 

*Formation*
The current lineup of stewards with scores 8/10 and over is as follows:

@DisruptionJoe
@Pop
@krrisis
@seedphrase
@bobjiang
@tjayrush
@Sirlupinwatson
@HelloShreyas
@lefterisjp
@linda
@griff 
@Fishbiscuit
@kyle
@austingriffith

*Mandate & Term*
The first Stewards Council will be active from the time the proposal passes for a period of 180 days, in line with the seasons cadence established as part of the proposal. One council would cover 2 seasons and there would be 2 councils/year.

NOTE*: the first council will have a slightly  shorter term covering S13 & S14. A decision can be made to extend term should adjustment period need to be longer.

The 180 day cadence matches the quarterly cadence of the Gitcoin DAO calendar and offers a great opportunity to reflect, expand and amplify the mission of GD. Cadence as follows:

Season 13 - 2.1 to 4.30 (GR13 | 3.9-3.24)
Season 14 - 5.1 to 7.30 (GR14 | 6.8-6.23)
Season 15 - 8.1 to 10.30 (GR15 | 9.7-9.22)
Season 16 - 11.1 to 1.31 (GR16 | 11.30-12.15)
and ongoing - any changes for holidays or other interruptions would be voted on

A milestone report will be presented at the end of the 180 day mark, ensuring the model is deemed valuable by the community and any essential and valuable learnings are incorporated in the model.

*Steward council mandate:*

- Keeping a ‘docket’ of ongoing proposals / their current status
- Ensure proposals follow template(s) 1 / creating any necessary adjustments to template(s)
- Perform an in-depth analysis of budget requests by workstreams. This includes:
-workstream performance and delivery(from the milestone reports included in the proposals)
-funds left over from previous seasons and taking them into account for the season
-list of contributors to workstream
-value of ask

- Consult on workstream performance/workstream leads’ milestone progress - address and act to solve any workstream issues that may occur within a season
-Participate in active discussion around proposals, timely voting
-Availability for Tally proposal creation and ratification once a proposal has passed Snapshot

Participation in a council call that will be scheduled halfway between the monthly steward call (aka every two weeks) for better alignment & broader DAO strategy discussion.

This mandate will evolve to take into account any learnings from the first council activity as we evolve the structure and the model based on optimum balance.

Abstract

Prior to Grants Round 12, the pool was governed by categories that assigned specific percentages of the pool to grants in specific disciplines or geographies.

In Grants Round 12, the community voted to run an experiment proposed by the Public Goods Funding workstream to test Vitalik’s theory that Quadratic Funding should be as effective at allocating funds as allocation via categories. By doing away with specific grant categories and having all grants listed together, we took a step towards simplifying and decentralizing matching. 

On the whole, the Public Goods Funding workstream believes the experiment was a success – directionally, at the very least. We believe the experiment was helpful in getting funding to more grants without complaints from top earners, and allowed us to test our assumptions about removing categories.

A statement from the PGF workstream:

We don’t know for sure yet if the main pool approach works best long-term, but we do know that there were major benefits for a longer tail of grantees and that it exceeded our expectations despite bugs, and we think it’s worth trying again before we drastically change course.
Vote

Voting

The forum post outlined three options – to continue with the cap at 2.5%, to continue with the cap at a different percentage (as proposed by the community), or a completely new community-led proposal, should anyone want to put a new structure forth. 
During the period the forum post was up, we did not receive any specific proposals for different percentages or structures to try in GR13.

As a result, we are structuring the vote as follows:

FOR: Repeat main pool with 2.5% cap

Stick to exactly what we did in GR12.

No individual grant’s matching contribution amount shall exceed 2.5% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $30K of the $1.2M pool).


AGAINST: Alternate proposal

Select this option if you have an alternate proposal you would like to table.

FDD is requesting $879,000 (93,500 GTC*) to fund Season 13 (S13) and replenish its reserves for S14.

High Level Budget Breakdown
Season 13 Budget Total = $596,295 = 74.1k GTC ($8.05/GTC*)
PLUS Season 14 Reserves = $596,295
Total Needed = $1,192,590
MNUS Current Reserves = $313,000
Total Amount requested at this time = $879,590 =109,265 GTC ($8.05/GTC*)
*Prices last updated 2/16/22

The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Snapshot and to Tally. The vote will be to send $879,590 in GTC at the current price when moved to Tally or the 20 day moving average (whichever is lower).

FDD Season 13 (Q1) 2022 Budget 8

*TL;DR*

Season 13 Financials
Season 13 is $155k increase = 34% budget increase
Season 13 Round Deliverables:

We currently have 18 outcomes for the next 90 days. Each outcome has 3 measurable key results that will determine if we achieved the outcome.
*Ground Control (Operations)*
 - 90% of decisions for mid-season budget changes and new proposals will go through our FDD Operating System rather than just Disruption Joe
- Disruption Joe will participate in our “source council 2” rather than having a workstream lead salary
Long term metric goals will be set to define the health of our initiatives

*Sybil Defenders*
- GitcoinDAO will run the end to end operational processes of the anti-sybil ml pipeline reducing our dependence on Blockscience
- A simulation software will be developed to let us better anticipate attacks and possibly increase training opportunities for the ml models
A human evaluations app built for effective training, improved inter-reviewer reliability at a lower cost per evaluation, and continuous data insights
- Work will continue on our long term vision A Community Based Roadmap for Sybil Detection Across Web 3 1
We will gain soft commitments and technical requirements from 3 partners to a sybil data sharing network built with a web 3 ethos & ethics

*Grants Investigation Agency (GIA)*
- We are using the GIA tool built last round to review the estimated 7-800 new grant applications that come in.
- Our goals include increasing the number of reviewers per grant, lower the cost per review, and define a mechanism design that will allow us to open up the review process to anyone via staking of GTC
Building the decentralized appeals integration and testing it
Reviewing and updating ALL of the grant eligibility policy documentation

This budget was reviewed by many stakeholders including the FDD Multisig Oversight Council, other workstream leads, and some Gitcoin Holdings team members. One question that came up multiple times was “If you had to slash $x from your budget, do you know what you would cut?” The answer is yes. However, it wouldn’t be to the benefit of Gitcoin. We could operationally function at half this budget for GR13, but we wouldn’t be doing anything to build scalability into our tech or our processes.","['Fund FDD as requested', 'Do not fund FDD as

This proposal seeks to amend, improve and standardise the proposal process for Gitcoin DAO. The purpose of this standardisation attempt is to improve transparency, accountability and accessibility when it comes to proposal review processes. 

New (improved) proposal framework:

All proposals should ideally follow the following format:

A tl;dr section at the top of the proposal summarizing the main points. This is for increased transparency and a smoother decision making process.

If applicable, a milestone report containing goals achieved during the previous quarter. The milestone report should include:

 - number of current contributors (marked as FT or PT)
 - funds spent to date - perhaps adopting some quarterly reporting?
 - any funds carrying over to the next quarter
 - notable achievements for the quarter
 - have the actions of the workstream brought back value into the DAO/treasury (if applicable/quantifiable)

NB> The flow of a proposal will still follow the steps laid out in the Gov process v2

These (and other) accountability metrics could form the basis of workstream health cards/reports that may serve not only as a catalyst for self improvement but as an opportunity to bring greater transparency, collaboration and accountability into the DAO ecosystem at large.

With this proposal we'd like to create the GitcoinDAO Operations Workstream and move it from an informal workstream to a proposal stage workstream. The DAO Operations (DAOops) workstream, is a workstream in service of the DAO and our adjacent workstreams.

Some of our focus areas: 

- Continue combining DAO / Gitcoin Holdings meetings and calendars to ensure we have one contiguous experience.
- Continue to advance regulatory considerations at both the DAO level and the workstream level
- Establish to bolster recruitment, onboarding, member growth, and retainment
- Continue to champion accounting best practices and templates to assist workstreams with budgeting, accounting and bookkeeping.
- Support CSDO with implementation of ratified items (like Discord changes, Notion changes, etc.)
- Continue to improve the Stewards experience and engagement levels
- Grow and combine our User Support efforts to ensure protocol users are well supported
- Finalize open community experience tasks like Notion, Discord, Sobol, etc.
- Open source much of this workstream’s work so that we may act as a guide for other DAOs

Our total budget request is 39.5K GTC for Q1 of 2022. 

*Summary*

As the governance rails begin to form for the DAO, it has become evident that operational support is a necessity. This workstream seeks to bring core operational functions to Gitcoin, while meeting the other workstreams' needs with templates, best practices and structure that will enable the growth and scale of Gitcoin for years to come.

If this proposal passes, we plan to distribute 32,717.33 GTC using WhalerDAO’s Astro-Drop tool to the users below who were eligible for the GTC Airdrop in May 2021, tried to claim their GTC during the airdrop window, but were not able to claim due to an error in the system ingesting their transactions.

Abstract:

The GTC airdrop earlier this year was a great step towards the decentralization of the Gitcoin ecosystem. Unfortunately, there are several users who were eligible for the drop because they funded the project Force DAO before the cut-off date for the airdrop. However, due to an error in the transaction validator these users were unable to claim their tokens. Specifically, when these users went to claim their tokens within the 30-day airdrop window, they were not allocated a percent of GTC tokens for their donations to Force DAO. After speaking with users and investigating online, it seems that those transactions were incorrectly dropped before the airdrop period. After some of these users reported it, they eventually had their transactions re-added, but after the cut-off date. This proposal is looking to retroactively compensate those users who were not able to claim their GTC due to the error. 

We will compensate the users linked below. All these users have demonstrated the necessary proof to be eligible for the airdrop and were responsive throughout the proposal process. We had two criteria in order to show eligible proof:

1) Proof of original donation which meets the original airdrop requirements
2) Proof of an attempted claim during the original airdrop period

If passed, we wish to distribute the specified amount (view linked pdf for exact amounts) through WhalerDAO’s Astro-Drop. The total amount of GTC to be distributed to these users is 32,717.33

This proposal, if passed, would grant Gitcoin $250K USD worth of PrimeDAO's $D2D governance token at a price of $0.50 per token for a total of 500K $D2D coins, equating to 0.5% of Prime DAO treasury.

The purpose of this alliance is to help ensure that Gitcoin and Prime can work together to build tooling for DAO2DAO coordination. 

Abstract

PrimeDAO is a collective of Web3 builders and DAOists dedicated to researching and building next-generation coordination tools for the Web3 ecosystem. PrimeDAO is working on a product suite which aims to provide collaboration-as-a-service, which include:

Prime Launch: A decentralized and curated token offering platform powered by Balancer V 2.0 that enables fair and user-friendly token launches. Projects can host a whitelisted seed sale to collect contributions at a fixed price, or conduct a liquid Launch without needing to write a single code.

Prime Deals: A platform for DAO to DAO interactions, where DAOs can propose, negotiate, and execute deals together. It is built on top of a modularised open-source framework of smart contracts with various interfaces that can easily be extended and adapted to any use case. The first supported interaction will be token swaps, followed by joint ventures, co-liquidity pooling, and co-farming that are facilitated by PrimeDAO’s agnostic, trustless, and flexible D2D contracts.

Proposal Inverter: A new funding receiver primitive that will allow DAOs to pool resources and co-fund open research/crowdfunded initiatives through semi-automated payment flows.

Prime Rating: A permissionless framework for quantifying DeFi protocol risk and quality and a research hub for DAO enthusiasts.

Prime Pools: An interface that facilitates the creation and management of DAO-governed liquidity pools which can enable the bridging of liquidity between allied ecosystems and creation of index pools.

We see this relationship complementing Gitcoin in the following ways:

- Enabling Gitcoin to have a direct stake in the future direction of PrimeDAO via 0.5% allocation of their governance token into the Gitcoin Treasury
- Strengthening ties between and improving the shared bandwidth of Gitcoin and Prime teams
- Collaborating on building DAO 2 DAO tooling to usher in the next era of coordination

Specification

The passing of this proposal would transfer $250,000 USD worth of $GTC to 0x567d220B0169836cBF351DF70A9c517096ec9De7, PrimeDAO’s specified Treasury address.

500K $D2D, a 0.5% allocation, would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin’s multisig address for easier delegation / voting.

Use of Funds

To ensure long-term alignment, Prime DAO will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.

To ensure long-term alignment, Gitcoin will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Prime DAO ecosystem.

The purpose of this alliance is to help ensure that Gitcoin and Developer DAO can work together to coordinate bringing more web2 developers into web3 than ever before through education and events, as well as supporting the creation and distribution of public goods.

Abstract

Developer DAO was started by Nader Dabit (https://twitter.com/dabit3). In just over two months they have grown to 5436 members, mostly experienced builders taking their first steps into the open web.

Their goals are to onboard, educate and support these new builders to foster & build web3 tools and public goods. These ambitions resonate well with projects and workstreams Gitcoin has previously supported such as Moonshot Collective, and we have already found some great ways to collaborate on a smaller scale.

We see this relationship complementing Gitcoin in the following ways:

- Enabling Gitcoin to have a voice in the future direction of Developer DAO via 5% allocation of their governance token into the Gitcoin Treasury
- Strengthening ties between and improve the shared bandwidth of Gitcoin and Developer DAO teams

- Collaborating on educational initiatives including workshops, events and hackathons with Austin Griffith and the Moonshot Collective workstream, to further the reach and impact of Gitcoin’s public goods mission (building for human thriving)
- Co-creating prototypes between Moonshot + Developer DAO that play well with the Loot ecosystem vibes / memes

Specification

The passing of this proposal would transfer 50,000 GTC to 0x7128f5ff32eD07Ce12E6a9deBE32BB40F9884b3C, Developer DAO’s specified Treasury address.

On the launch of Developer DAO’s governance token, a 5% allocation would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin’s multisig address for easier delegation / voting.

Use of Funds

To ensure long term alignment, Developer DAO will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.

To ensure long term alignment, Gitcoin will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Developer DAO ecosystem.

Abstract

Gitcoin has historically utilized categories, based on Grant types, to determine matching pool allocations based on a percentage of the overall matching pool fund during Grant Rounds. During the GR11 Finale Event this overall strategy was questioned by Vitalik Buterin, the argument being Quadratic Funding should be just as effective during Grant Rounds using no categories.

During GR12, the Public Goods Funding workstream wants to test Vitalik’s theory that Quadratic Funding should be as effective at allocating funds as allocation via categories. By doing away with specific grant categories and having all grants listed together, we hope to simplify and decentralize matching. This is a radical change in how we’ve historically set matching funds for grants’ matching pools, but a challenge we believe will help to better understand how to best implement Quadratic Funding.


[The forum post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-gr12-matching-pool-allocations/9007/24) outlines the above in more detail –- and this Snapshot vote will decide if and how we test this approach in GR12.

Vote

The three options to vote on are:

Option 1: Single Pool Experiment

Use GR12 as a test case to run an experiment whereby we do away with categories.

The GR12 main pool will be a single matching pool fund/distribution of $1,000,000 in matching for the round. No individual grant’s matching contribution amount shall exceed 2.5% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $25k)

Pros: We get to run a proper experiment and try out a new approach to funding

Cons: The experiment is an unknown vs. our tried & trusted categories


Option 2: No experiment

Stick with the same category-based approach we’ve been using in the past – specifically, run GR12 with the same categories as GR11.

Pros: Less uncertainty (rinse & repeat prior round approach)
Cons: We remain in the dark as to how a Single Pool might perform

 
Option 3: Do a 50/50

Run 50% of the matching pot as a single pool experiment, and 50% category-based as before.

This option was proposed in response to the governance proposal that outlined Option 1. This was proposed as a ‘happy medium’ – going more gradually vs. doing a full-on experiment in GR12.

Pros: We get to experiment a bit while maintaining the category approach for half the pool
Cons: Having both at once is more complex and potentially very confusing for grantees","['Single Pool Experiment', 'No experiment', 'Do a 50/50']",1637613000,1638217800,13666591,closed,0x7E052Ef7B4bB7E5A45F331128AFadB1E589deaF1,"{'id': 'gitcoindao.eth', 'name': 'Gitcoin'}","['matching', 'pool', 'allocations']","['snapshot', 'vote', 'looking', 'finalize', 'decision', 'around', 'gitcoin', 'grants', 'round', 'allocations', 'proposed', 'discussed', 'forum', 'post', 'https', 'abstract', 'gitcoin', 'historically', 'utilized', 'categories', 'based', 'grant', 'types', 'determine', 'matching', 'pool', 'allocations', 'based', 'percentage', 'overall', 'matching', 'pool', 'fund', 'grant', 'rounds', 'finale', 'event', 'overall', 'strategy', 'questioned', 'vitalik', 'buterin', 'argument', 'quadratic', 'funding', 'effective', 'grant', 'rounds', 'using', 'categories', 'public', 'goods', 'funding', 'workstream', 'wants', 'test', 'vitalik', 'theory', 'quadratic', 'funding', 'effective', 'allocating', 'funds', 'allocation', 'via', 'categories', 'away', 'specific', 'grant', 'categories', 'grants', 'listed', 'together', 'hope', 'simplify', 'decentralize', 'matching', 'radical', 'change', 'historically', 'set', 'matching', 'funds', 'grants', 'matching', 'pools', 'challenge', 'believe', 'help', 'better', 'understand', 'best', 'implement', 'quadratic', 'funding', 'forum', 'post', 'https', 'outlines', 'detail', 'snapshot', 'vote', 'decide', 'test', 'approach', 'vote', 'three', 'options', 'vote', 'option', 'single', 'pool', 'experiment', 'use', 'test', 'case', 'run', 'experiment', 'whereby', 'away', 'categories', 'main', 'pool', 'single', 'matching', 'pool', 'matching', 'round', 'individual', 'grant', 'matching', 'contribution', 'amount', 'shall', 'exceed', 'overall', 'matching', 'pool', 'fund', 'pros', 'get', 'run', 'proper', 'experiment', 'try', 'new', 'approach', 'funding', 'cons', 'experiment', 'unknown', 'tried', 'trusted', 'categories', 'option', 'experiment', 'stick', 'approach', 'using', 'past', 'specifically', 'run', 'categories', 'pros', 'less', 'uncertainty', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'prior', 'round', 'approach', 'cons', 'remain', 'dark', 'single', 'pool', 'might', 'perform', 'option', 'run', 'matching', 'pot', 'single', 'pool', 'experiment', 'option', 'proposed', 'response', 'governance', 'proposal', 'outlined', 'option', 'proposed', 'happy', 'medium', 'going', 'gradually', 'experiment', 'pros', 'get', 'experiment', 'bit', 'maintaining', 'category', 'approach', 'half', 'pool', 'cons', 'complex', 'potentially', 'confusing', 'grantees']", matching pool allocations,this snapshot vote is looking to finalize a decision around the gitcoin grants round  allocations proposed and discussed abstractgitcoin has historically utilized categories based on grant types to determine matching pool allocations based on a percentage of the overall matching pool fund during grant rounds during the  finale event this overall strategy was questioned by vitalik buterin the argument being quadratic funding should be just as effective during grant rounds using no categoriesduring  the public goods funding workstream wants to test vitalik’s theory that quadratic funding should be as effective at allocating funds as allocation via categories by doing away with specific grant categories and having all grants listed together we hope to simplify and decentralize matching this is a radical change in how we’ve historically set matching funds for grants’ matching pools but a challenge we believe will help to better understand how to best implement quadratic funding outlines the above in more detail – and this snapshot vote will decide if and how we test this approach in  three options to vote on areoption  single pool experimentuse  as a test case to run an experiment whereby we do away with categoriesthe  main pool will be a single matching pool funddistribution of  in matching for the round no individual grant’s matching contribution amount shall exceed  of the overall matching pool fund ie  we get to run a proper experiment and try out a new approach to fundingcons the experiment is an unknown vs our tried  trusted categoriesoption  no experimentstick with the same categorybased approach we’ve been using in the past – specifically run  with the same categories as  less uncertainty rinse  repeat prior round approachcons we remain in the dark as to how a single pool might perform option  do a   of the matching pot as a single pool experiment and  categorybased as beforethis option was proposed in response to the governance proposal that outlined option  this was proposed as a ‘happy medium’ – going more gradually vs doing a fullon experiment in  we get to experiment a bit while maintaining the category approach for half the poolcons having both at once is more complex and potentially very confusing for grantees,en

### Workstream Mandate: Progressively Decentralize Gitcoins core services and products.

### Q3 Achievements & Budget Deployment
In Q3 of 2021 the dGTC workstream utilized the budget granted to take the Decentralized Grants platform from a rough draft concept to working POC. We have kicked off a Grant Round for the Moonshot Collective team which contained 11 grants. Since the start of the round we have had 3 new grant submissions which have gone through the approval process and you can see on the platform at https://grants.gtcdao.net/

### Out of the 41,300 GTC received for Q3, we have 10k GTC and 40k DAI remaining which we are moving forward to our Q4 budget.

### Q4 Goals High Level
During Q4 the Decentralize Gitcoin workstream will (and has already started to) continue to collect feedback and improve the user interface and user experience, build additional features based on what is most important to run the round in GR12 and for claiming payouts, start working on implementing active sybil resistance and basic curation, and kick off the DID/Sybil Score Aggregation project and DevOps/Data initiative.

https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-integrate-dcompass-within-dgitcoin-to-build-dquests-dknowledge/8836

Abstract
This proposal offers integration of dCompass to the Decentralize Gitcoin Workstream also know as dGitcoin.

dCompass’ primary mission will be to onboard, guide and educate users about:
- the Gitcoin ecosystem
- sustainable open source software & trustworthy Web3 protocols and tools
- decentralization & governance
- DeFi & NFTs

Our workstream will be responsible for decentralizing and improving the Gitcoin Quests, which will become dQuests, as well as the Gitcoin Knowledge Base, which will become dKnowledge.

dKnowledge will contain educational information and FAQs about the Gitcoin ecosystem, Web3 projects, and technologies.
The content within the Knowledge Base will be used to populate quest preparation materials.

dQuests will display the content from dKnowledge in a more engaging way and it will reward users for validating their learnings and actions.

Built on a decentralized infrastructure, dQuests is a gamified platform where users will be able to progress through various types of quests—like quizzes, code challenges, and on-chain transactions—gaining the ability to verify their diverse skillsets.

By successfully completing a quest, users will be able to:

- earn XPs and increase their ranking
- mint Quest & Badge NFTs with a random rarity
- and grow their Dynamic Skill Tree NFT by validating their learnings & actions through on-chain micro-credentials.

We are requesting a total of 26145 GTC for Q4, allocated gradually upon milestone completion, to see the budget and range of activities in detail refer to this link: https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/gitcoin1/original/2X/6/6229c5ceeebb4be55cd841d58fdfad2d021e130e.png

QmZYrZKBaExvZsnNNfKbFixJe2C7PNY96DtoF1tQtdNhLN,Issue a 40k GTC grant to CLR.fund,"## Summary

This proposal, if passed, would issue a grant of 40k GTC (0.008% of the GTC treasury) to CLR.Fund, a project with a similar mission as Gitcoin (fund public goods) but with a complementary product.

## Abstract

CLR.Fund is another prominent Quadratic Funding project in the Ethereum ecosystem with a mission/ethos that is similar to Gitcoin. This proposal issues them a grant, which solves for the near term the funding of CLR.Fund.

Secondarily, this proposal if passed would

- Extend [previous friendly contact](https://twitter.com/nanexcool/status/1383481998417678342) between Kevin Owocki and Auryn MacMillian to formally affirm that Gitcoin & CLRFund are friendly projects built around similar missions.
- Change the narrative created by other competitive projects working on the same domain. That is the misguided belief that we must have sharp elbows - boxing each other out from each other’s users and demonstrate loud social media clap-backs.
- It is possible that the goodwill between the two projects could be extended into a formal integration or partnership one day - especially with the [Decentralize Gitcoin workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-decentralize-gitcoin/180) gaining speed.
- By pushing new tech and solutions on top of QF (such as MACI), CLR.Fund can act as a testbed/testnet for future gitcoin features and visa-versa.

- Having a stable token for the GitcoinDAO allows the DAO to fund work streams with certainty, instead of being victims of market fluctuation.

- Using $oneGTC as the preferred token for rewarding contributions to workstreams will lead to retaining more value within the Gitcoin ecosystem. 

This allocation was proposed on the forum in this Initial proposal: [oneGTC](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gtc-backed-economy/8033) 👀open for comments/feedback. Discussed by Stewards and the wider community for over 3 weeks. 

After engaging with the ICHI community, discussing the potential benefits, use cases, and clarifying the value proposition of using a native stable coin we have gathered enough support to bring it to a vote. 

## Voting ""Yes""

Proposal & Stake - $50k in funds for the DAO, from Gitcoin Holdings Inc., pledged towards this matching round, to build GitcoinDAO.

Deliberation - Through discussion on this proposal and a Snapshot vote, the stewards will ratify the creation of a $50k side-round for GR10 that creates a matching pool for anyone working on the DAO.

Implementation - The community will be invited to post Grants for their GitcoinDAO related work. The $50k from Gitcoin Holdings will be sent to the multisig. The round will be run, and paid out as per normal.

QmQe6fHVDsvE91ShNagvFojetuWHu6xKn7izk46Dg2cQmK,[Execution Phase] How do we best go forward to divest our position of AKITA?,"After some conversations with the Akita community it has become clear that the best path to maximize our ETH outcome is to enable some form of participation with them.

Highlights:

There will be a buy back and burn program that funds the AKITA LBP, for every 1 AKITA purchased X will be burned. Specifics not finalized.

The ETH raised here will be put into the LBP with a time of completion set for 3 months.

Based on our conversations I propose the following:

Option 1:

We split the LP Tokens as follows:
40% to Gitcoin
40% to Akita (streamed over the length of the LBP through Sablier)
20% to a Charity (yet to be chosen) funds ETH raised will be delivered VIA Gitcoin, post sale.


Option 2: 

We split the LP Tokens as follows:
80% to Gitcoin
20% to a Charity (yet to be chosen) funds ETH raised will be delivered VIA Gitcoin, post sale.

We agree to burn more Akita via Sablier by streaming to the 0x000 address Y tokens for each X Akita in the LBP.

Option 3:

We don't split the LP Tokens

We agree to burn more Akita via Sablier by streaming to the 0x000 address Y tokens for each X Akita in the LBP.

Qmf6hFhnn3yhMYE7omvEoXTEKjzYuKeAzxK7X2t5MkvCF2,Future Salaries (an Ethereum salaries widget) in addition to Grants,"Owocki is a fan of quadratic funding, but it has big deficiencies:

* Many people do not know that they need Hilbert spaces theory or molecular biology very much, word processor users don’t know that they need a reliable optimizing compiler that is in turn may be based on dependent-types lambda-calculus research, etc. and they won’t fund it. Especially science and software libraries public goods suffer severe underfunding when funding quadratic, because every funder cannot know every science topic.

* When doing quadratic funding it inevitably goes much random - some projects are funded too much and some are severely underfunded (among other reasons, because well-funded projects can buy SEO of their ads).

* Anti-sybil is improving but it can’t be perfect.

* If some important text or software is buried on the 100000th position of Google, the world gets stuck: nobody knows that the missing component is a problem and therefore nobody fixes the problem.

So, we need a much more objective mean of funding. Ideally funding amount should be calculated by an algorithm, not by stupid us.

We don’t yet have an algorithm capable to predict the future of the human work. The solution is to use a prediction market to predict a future algorithm results. So the market decides.

Traders (when motivated by money) are much more careful, hard working, and through than some random quadratic voter. Traders are therefore multitudinous that much reduces randomness and bias. They are to follow an objective algorithm that motivates them and so the market is striving for objective results.

So, I provide a software that “forces” traders to “calculate” how much which project to fund.

There will appear a new profession: people that search for underrepresented public good projects and do SEO for them. That’s important.

It should be in addition to quadratic Grants. Users should have choice where to pay.

This software is almost fully implemented (and there is a little outdated pull request to integrate it into a GitCoin page).

The proposal:

* Pay for quality audit of the smart contracts.
* Assign me to finish integrating it into GitCoin site.
* Do a good design.
* Deploy on production.

QmR1mSZaQP8HEMU8nSMeBM5pVvkGoGG3TVu2H5aDuXyB8m,Implement Akita sale/stream as a Balancer pool,"This proposal came too late to be one of the options in the [Akita, a path forward](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmUoBpLsMSZ7Aq1UEzvEyGyTdR8Reeb8qQFGUhcQLqcQMM) poll, which at the moment is leading with ""Sell 10%, stream 90%"" and ""Liquidate 100%"" so I will propose it as a further discussion on the merits of how to implement it. This was posted on June 1st as a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/avsa/status/1399892313007083522?s=21) and gathered some positive feedback from many of the community representatives.

## The issue with the two main proposals

* There's not enough market depth to liquidate all Akita tokens without losing a lot of value for Gitcoin. Even if there are serious doubts about the long term viability of the Akita community, we have a responsibility to maximize the value gained for Gitcoin. 
* Locking Akita on Sablier doesn't put that capital to good use, and if the market crashes and recovers and crashes again during before the stream is over, then there was a missed opportunity.


## The Proposed Implementation

1) Sell 10% of Akita in any exchange, put it in the Gitcoin treasury
2) Sell yet another 10% into ETH. 
3) Create a Scheduled Balancer pool with the 10% ETH obtained in step 2 and all the remaining Akita.
4) Set up the pool controller to programmatically change the ratio over a period P so that it inverts from a 10% ETH 90% AKITA into a 90% ETH and 10% AKITA
5) After period is over, the community can decide what to do with the remaining tokens. 

Those types of pools are usually called **Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools** and are often used to launch new tokens that don't have liquidity. In this case, the token has launched but it would still bootstrap the liquidity. You can read more about LBPs on this article about [Radicle](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/radicles-new-record-lbp-sale-shows-that-lbps-are-here-to-stay-4c81e15a4d4d).

To make sure the market doesn't dump immediately, we could do step 1 and 2 using [Gnosis Auctions](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosis-auction-launch-390124d56248): this would take off some buy pressure immediately and then make sure the starting price of the LBP is closer to what other market makers have.


## The end result is that:
* At the end of the period, Gitcoin will have sold most of their Akita, at a fairer market price, similarly to a Dollar Cost Averaging strategy
* Akita community gets a much more liquid market, a ""billion"" dollars deep (emphasis on the air quotes). This will reduce the impact any single seller can have on the final price.
* All trades that are executed against this pool will earn fees for Gitcoin, so in periods of high volatility Gitcoin is leveraging its massive Akita Holdings to generate Yield
* There will be a constant sell pressure on Akita, but it's one that is scheduled and known


## Variants and Risks

Balancer Pools are quite flexible and we could do other options like having a pool that starts at 91% Akita, 3% GTC, 3% ETH and 3% DAI. Or we could add all the dog tokens into a big billion dollar pile of dog ~~poo~~ money.

Pools also don't necessarily need to be locked: we can add a smart controller so that Gitcoin DAO can accelerate the schedule at a later vote, or simply change it completely and use the [Pie DAO](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-pie-smart-pools-85a77a2dc22e) so that ratios can be changed at the will of GTC holders. Also, at any point, Gitcoin could vote to take the liquidity out of its own pool and receive it in either token of the pool.

It's also important to note that **LBPs are different than just selling a token**: the pool wants to keep a constant ratio at all times to reach its target, be it 10%, 25% or 90%. So it means that *the pool will both sell and buy akita for ETH* to keep the target ratio–that's how AMMs work. A LBP changes that target ratio slowly over time, but it also is reacting to the market in real time. It means that, if akita drops to near 0, then the pool will automatically be buying akita with ETH until it reaches the desired balance, so almost ETH would be drained from the pool. But that ETH came from the Akita sale in the step 2, and the end result would be the same if the strategy was to stream or liquidate it anyway. On the other hand, if the market goes up again, that will mean the pool will start selling the cheap akita it bought back to ETH (plus the fees it got during the period) which is why pools make money from volatility. 

Disclaimer: I work for Balancer labs, but if the community wants to they can use other solutions. Balancer also has a ""LBP referral program"" but I am perfectly willing to either not claim it or to donate the BAL gained to Gitcoin.

## Period P

This proposal leaves the P period open. The ending date of this poll is after the resolution of the [""Akita - a path forward"" poll](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmUoBpLsMSZ7Aq1UEzvEyGyTdR8Reeb8qQFGUhcQLqcQMM), so votes should take the result of the other snapshot in consideration.

1) Stream: a LBP of duration of 2 years
2) Intermediary: make the LBP last 1 year
3) Liquidation: a short LBP over 1 week
4) Do an LBP but in [another configuration](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-akita-liquidate-akita-for-eth/4255) or platform
5) No LBP: just lock it Sablier or dump it all in uniswap, depending on the results of the Akita poll

Qmcr1T1EZRZmvP4fvbFvDSdTmhLBCPmkYTdweSWdiyFj65,Impose Governance Standards & Processes,"# Background:
There are currently three votes around what to do with the AKITA held by the Gitcoin Multisig. Each one, seemingly, have somewhat contradictory mandates. This is because there have not been standards and processes put in place as of yet that establish ""what occurs in scenario X if Y"", i.e. ""what occurs when two contradictory votes pass, prior to execution of the first?"" (double jeopardy, to some extent).

# Proposal
This proposal is rather meta. It is a proposal to begin a set of proposals to set standards and processes that proposers must follow to ensure validity and enforce-ability. We should set rules for issues such as:
- Double Jeopardy
- Proposal Parameter Validity (start time, end time, start block, etc)
- Proposal Process Validity (template, forum -> snapshot -> onchain?)
- etc.

# Prior Art
Yam was the first to establish a number of rules that we can look at for how to potentially impose standards for off-chain voting. Many protocols have followed since (some better than others). Yam established rules for what is considered a valid off-chain vote, specifying:
1. Start date: must always be in the future, and have some amount of time (t+6hrs) from creation of the vote
2. End date: must run for x amount of time
3. Start block: must be within x minutes of vote start time

Any vote that does not meet said criteria would be considered invalid and potentially censored from snapshot by controllers of the associated ENS. What I like about the above benchmarks for standards is that in general, most spammers won't follow the above and can be weeded out quickly and easily as well as ensuring fairness/time to prepare for votes, killing two birds with one stone.

Likewise, there must be many new people from all over the world joining in like me, and I think it's time for the community to consider supporting multiple languages, so that more people from more regions can join in and make the community even more DAO.

Suggestions for supporting multiple languages.
1. the official forum to add multi-language entrance, friends from different regions choose to enter their own language directory to participate in the discussion, similar to the directory function. I am also a developer myself, if necessary, I am willing to participate in it!
2. the official website to increase the multilingual version, the official multiple product pages, including many learning materials and documents can support multilingual, convenient for friends in different regions to participate and learn.

The above is my first proposal as a newcomer, welcome to correct any deficiencies (English is automatically translated from Deepl. (Cry with laughter)

For the multilingual proposal, especially important is the Chinese users, which is a very large team, never lack of excellent developers, investors, evangelists, and a large number of high-quality Internet groups willing to actively participate in governance.



中文原文：

各位社区的朋友们好，我是gitcoin的新朋友，这个社区所构想的未来特别迷人，对我来说这是个自由的新大陆。
同样，一定有许多世界各地的新朋友和我一样也加入了进来，我觉得社区可以考虑支持多语言了，让更多地区的朋友加入进来，让社区更加的DAO。

支持多语言的建议：
1. 官方论坛增加多语言的入口，不同地区的朋友选择进入各自语言目录参与讨论，类似目录功能。我本身也是一名开发者，如果有需要，我非常愿意参与进来
2. 官方网站增加多语言的版本，官方的多个产品页，包括许多的学习资料和文档可以支持多语言，方便不同地区的朋友参与和学习。

以上就是作为新手的我，第一次提案，有不足的地方欢迎指正（英文从Deepl自动翻译而来 (笑哭)）

QmaNNqMPXYMbuBgu8Q5SuLPD2GDoAnrsDMN361cjefKPYP,Proposal: Transfer SACKS/ETH LP from Multisig to Governance Timelock,"Continued from [this thread](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/rfc-transfer-sacks-lp-position-to-gitcoin-governance-timelock/3262?u=monet-supply) in the Gitcoin forum.

Currently the [$SACKS/ETH LP position](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3a9b094016ce9206a6d83c6c9c61bbe34ecac81e486820ba32dc84805e099cc3) is held in the [Gitcoin Grants Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde21f729137c5af1b01d73af1dc21effa2b8a0d6). This allows for greater flexibility for using some of the LP assets to fund grants matching rounds. On the other hand, this flexibility could make users nervous about holding $SACKS for fear of losing liquidity.

I'd like to propose transferring the LP position to the [Gitcoin governance timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde21f729137c5af1b01d73af1dc21effa2b8a0d6#tokentxnsErc721). This creates an ~11 day delay between submitting a proposal to remove liquidity and actually having it removed (2 day proposal delay period, 7 day voting period, and 2 day timelock). Greater confidence will hopefully lead to greater long term funding impact from the SACKS position.","['Yes, transfer LP to GTC timelock', 'No, leave LP in grants multisig']",1622509200,1622941200,12545400,closed,0x8d07D225a769b7Af3A923481E1FdF49180e6A265,"{'id': 'gitcoindao.eth', 'name': 'Gitcoin'}","['proposal', 'transfer', 'lp', 'multisig', 'governance', 'timelock']","['continued', 'thread', 'https', 'gitcoin', 'forum', 'currently', 'lp', 'position', 'https', 'held', 'gitcoin', 'grants', 'multisig', 'https', 'allows', 'greater', 'flexibility', 'using', 'lp', 'assets', 'fund', 'grants', 'matching', 'rounds', 'hand', 'flexibility', 'could', 'make', 'users', 'nervous', 'holding', 'sacks', 'fear', 'losing', 'liquidity', 'like', 'propose', 'transferring', 'lp', 'position', 'gitcoin', 'governance', 'timelock', 'https', 'creates', 'day', 'delay', 'submitting', 'proposal', 'remove', 'liquidity', 'actually', 'removed', 'day', 'proposal', 'delay', 'period', 'day', 'voting', 'period', 'day', 'timelock', 'greater', 'confidence', 'hopefully', 'lead', 'greater', 'long', 'term', 'funding', 'impact', 'sacks', 'position']",proposal transfer sackseth lp from multisig to governance timelock,continued from  in the gitcoin forumcurrently the  is held in the  this allows for greater flexibility for using some of the lp assets to fund grants matching rounds on the other hand this flexibility could make users nervous about holding sacks for fear of losing liquidityid like to propose transferring the lp position to the  this creates an  day delay between submitting a proposal to remove liquidity and actually having it removed  day proposal delay period  day voting period and  day timelock greater confidence will hopefully lead to greater long term funding impact from the sacks position,en
