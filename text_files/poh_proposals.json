        "body": ">HIP 41\n>Title: Allow verbal confirmation for registrating users\n>authors: avsa.eth and nicobilinkis.eth\n>Status: Phase 2\n>Created: 2022-28-3\n>URL:https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-41-allow-verbal-confirmation-for-registrating-users/1888\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis would add the option to have a user, instead of holding a sign with their address, give a verbal confirmation of their public address. Either visual or verbal confirmation would be accepted.\n\n## Abstract\n\n\nThe user, when onboarding, should be able to decide either to make a visual or verbal confirmation (or both) of their public address during their video. \n\nThe current rules for profile submission require a mandatory sign (can be a screen) showing the full Ethereum address. This has been a point of failure for many people. Although many efforts where made to help resolve those problems, such as HIP-27 allowing for one character mistakes, the sign itself is just one more step to fight deep-fakes. Considering all those facts, we believe that it's feasible to replace that sign with a verbal confirmation. Instead of showing a sign with the ETH address the submitter would have to say out loud a series of words that confirm ownership of both address and media files.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe advantages are clear:\n\nEasier flow, as the user can do all the process in one take in the video by following simple instructions on screen\nNo props needed. Human doesn’t need to fish around to get a pen and a paper or find a second screen, nor spend a long time trying to slowly copy the address.\nMore accessible. For people with movement or vision impairment, this would make it easier for them to be included in the system\nDOESN’T EXCLUDE SIGNS: users who still prefer to hold signs (maybe someone who is speech impaired, or just shy) can still use visual confirmation of their address.\n\n## Implementation\n\n\n**BIP 039 words**\n\nThe user must look at the camera and say (in one of the officially acepted languages): \n\"I certify that I am a real human and that I am not already in this registry. My identifier is \"\n\nFollowing by an identifier which is obtained by converting the hexadecimal ethereum address into base 2048, then converting those digits into [the official BIP039 dictionary words](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md). The user then must speak the **first 6 resulting words in the same same language as the phrase**.\n> \n> Example:\n> The address **0x17a91203a9e9c3519c2f76210497ef7f4be2352f**\n> Would be spoken as: **Able Barrel, Debris Siege, Pretty Inquiry.** (commas and spacing are optional)\n\nThe phrase derived from the address would be generated **automatically** in the **DAPP UI**. Also it would be shown on every profile that chose this verification method, so that validators can still curate the list as usual. \n\nThe BIP039 dictionary **MUST** be in the same language as the rest of the phrase, so when a future HIP approves a new language, this HIP will not need to be updated. If a future HIP approves a new official Proof of Humanity language that does not have an official BIP039 dictionary yet, then the HIP that adds the new language must also define an official word dictionary for the purposes of this HIP.\n",

A poll made on Snapshot was used to gather a list of addresses of people interested in having that role.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOriginal and deleted proposal was in this link: [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/0x32a19b0132c8e2e6c19bf3cd74138416f9a5f780e672a58982d00cbd827813f9). This is the IPFS link for the proposal (that does not contain the votes): https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmbDBvUJNhyaWUu1nhGPSEpuCxqhWP9hwC2FdQuJNM1tVY\n\nAs an alternative, this is the IPFS of signed votes for proposers: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYwumh4oS8N6iUvqEEhsJZkaN2DY7dfkcvrNRttzAoUTP?filename=ipfs_signed_proposors.txt. This list was provided by Laurent Genoud, developer and admin of the official Snapshot Telegram group ([Telegram: Contact @snapshotlabs](https://t.me/snapshotlabs/7972)).\n\nThe poll was used in order to guarantee that proposers belonged to the registry.

        "body": "> HIP: 36\n> title: Registration Validity Extension and Change of Renewal Period\n> author: @senryu @NingFid @fnanni \n> status: Phase 3\n> created: 2022-02-01\n\n\n\n**Simple Summary**\n\nThe validity of a registered profile is 1 year. This proposal aims to extend the duration of each profile to 2 years and change the renewal period duration to 3 months.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nTo prevent high attrition in the registry due to renewal cost and simultaneous $UBI sell-off to fund renewal, we propose a change on the validity of the registered profiles through a change of the parameter `submissionDuration` to 2 years.\n\nMoreover, the current setup to remove registered profiles is halted for the entire renewal duration of 6 months which is too long of ‘immunity’ period for possibly missed non-conforming and/or suspicious profiles. Another issue that was brought up is for those who wish to be removed but cannot initiate it(no option)until the 6-month renewal period is over. This can be done through a parameter change of of `renewalPeriodDuration` to 3 months.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIn order for the Proof of Humanity protocol to maintain the momentum in registration and remain as the largest on-chain identity system, we need to address the pain points in submission primarily the total cost to register and renew.\n\nWhile the ETH usd value halved since [Phase 1](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-36-extending-the-registration-period-to-avoid-gas-costs/1538/4), ETH price forecast remains positive in the long term due to Ethereum’s widespread use (https://cryptofees.info/; https://money-movers.info/; ) and net issuance (https://watchtheburn.com/insights) relatively lower than the burned ETH from fees as of today. Might sound more speculative than concrete motivation to push this proposal through, but the Proof of Humanity registration being denominated in ETH is significantly affected by price changes.\n\nMoreover, there are few other preceding profile submission requirement alterations being proposed [HIP-32](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-32-define-text-to-be-read-for-profile-renewal/1157),   [HIP 33](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-33-registry-protection-against-puppet-and-farming-attacks/1357/2),  [HIP 27](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275) that are yet to be implemented and may be enforced at the same time as many profiles need renewing. We need more time to re-educate users and curators of the new process as we strive to balance fair incentivization and high-quality curated sybil-proof list of humans.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe proposed parameter changes on submissionDuration and renewalPeriodDuration will affect profiles:\n\n* About to expire after 1 year in the registry\n* Have renewed prior to the change and will have the new validity as specified in the change\n* Current registrants not in renewal period\n* Incoming submissions\n\n**Implementation**\n\nA transaction with the following specifications is expected to be executed from the Proof of Humanity governor:\n\n* Contract address: 0xC5E9dDebb09Cd64DfaCab4011A0D5cEDaf7c9BDb.\n* Function: changeDurations(uint64 _submissionDuration, uint64 _renewalPeriodDuration, uint64 _challengePeriodDuration).\n* Function parameters:\n– `_submissionDuration`: 63115200 (twice the current value, i.e. 2 years).\n– `_renewalPeriodDuration`: 7889400 (half of the current value, i.e. 3 months).\n– `_challengePeriodDuration`: 302400 (stays the same).\n* Value to be sent: 0 ETH.",

A poll made on Snapshot was used to gather a list of addresses of people interested in having that role.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOriginal and deleted proposal was in this link: [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/0x32a19b0132c8e2e6c19bf3cd74138416f9a5f780e672a58982d00cbd827813f9). This is the IPFS link for the proposal (that does not contain the votes): https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmbDBvUJNhyaWUu1nhGPSEpuCxqhWP9hwC2FdQuJNM1tVY\n\nAs an alternative, this is the IPFS of signed votes for proposers: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYwumh4oS8N6iUvqEEhsJZkaN2DY7dfkcvrNRttzAoUTP?filename=ipfs_signed_proposors.txt. This list was provided by Laurent Genoud, developer and admin of the official Snapshot Telegram group ([Telegram: Contact @snapshotlabs](https://t.me/snapshotlabs/7972)).\n\nThe poll was used in order to guarantee that proposers belonged to the registry. There was only one option “I offer myself as Proposer”.

This proposal aims to extend the duration of each profile to 2 years and change the renewal period duration to 3 months.\n \nAbstract\n\nTo prevent high attrition in the registry due to renewal cost and simultaneous $UBI sell-off to fund renewal, we propose a change on the validity of the registered profiles through a change of the parameter submissionDuration to 2 years. \nMoreover, the current setup to remove registered profiles is halted for the entire renewal duration of 6 months which is too long of ‘immunity’ period for possibly missed non-conforming and/or suspicious profiles. Another issue that was brought up is for those who wish to be removed but cannot initiate it(no option)until the 6-month renewal period is over. This can be done through a parameter change of renewalPeriodDuration to 3 months.\n \n \nMotivation\n\nIn order for the Proof of Humanity protocol to maintain the momentum in registration and remain as the largest on-chain identity system, we need to address the pain points in submission primarily the total cost to register and renew. \n \nWhile the ETH usd value halved since Phase 1, ETH price forecast remains positive in the long term due to Ethereum’s widespread use (https://cryptofees.info/; https://money-movers.info/; ) and net issuance (https://watchtheburn.com/insights) relatively lower than the burned ETH from fees as of today. Might sound more speculative than concrete motivation to push this proposal through, but the Proof of Humanity registration being denominated in ETH is significantly affected by price changes.\n\nMoreover, there are few other preceding profile submission requirement alterations being proposed HIP-32 https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-32-define-text-to-be-read-for-profile-renewal/1157 HIP 33 https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-33-registry-protection-against-puppet-and-farming-attacks/1357/2\nHIP 27 https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275\nthat are yet to be implemented and may be enforced at the same time as many profiles need renewing. We need more time to re-educate users and curators of the new process as we strive to balance fair incentivization and high-quality curated sybil-proof list of humans.\n \nSpecification\n\nThe proposed parameter changes on submissionDuration and renewalPeriodDuration will affect profiles:\n- About to expire after 1 year in the registry\n- Have renewed prior to the change and will have the new validity as specified in the change\n- Current registrants not in renewal period\n- Incoming submissions\n \nDiscussions found in the threads:\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/extending-the-registration-period-with-one-year/1316?u=ningfid\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-36-extending-the-registration-period-to-avoid-gas-costs/1538?u=ningfid\n ",

This proposal would make it so a single such mistake would no longer be grounds for rejection. This would not reduce the security of the profile or the PoH registry in any practical terms as will be demonstrated below.\nMotivation\n\nSubmitters will often write down their address by hand instead of printing it or displaying it on another screen. This might be because they don’t have a printer or another device with a screen they can easily display it on, or simply because they find writing the address by hand to be more convenient at that time.\n\nAs one might expect, it is often the case that submitters make mistakes when copying their address. Sometimes, these are significant errors such as the omission of a large part of the address, in which case it might be possible for an attacker to generate matching addresses, but often the error will affect only one character. We may distinguish 4 types of errors:\n\n```\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n\nThis proposal would allow at most one of the above three errors in a displayed address. The effects on the security of an address (i.e. on the ability of an attacker to find a private key generating an address which would match the displayed address) would be the following:\n\n```\n- omitted character: 9.32 bits: lg(40*16): 40 positions to insert the missing character which has 16 possible values\n- mistaken character: 9.23 bits: lg(40*15): 40 characters with 15 possible invalid values each\n- swapped adjacent characters: 5.29 bits: lg(39): 39 possible swaps of adjacent characters, although note that this can be slightly lower still since not all swaps have an effect (e.g. in “abbd”, swapping the two \"b\"s has no effect)\n- additional character: 5.36 bits: lg(41): 41 choices for which character to delete\n```\n\nNote that if a character is missing (case 1.) the three other cases are no longer allowed, and conversely, if the displayed address has all 40 characters (case 2. and 3.), the first and fourth cases are no longer allowed, and if there is an extra character, then only case 4. may be considered. As a result the maximum security loss is max(lg(N_1), lg(N_2 + N_3), lg(N_4)) = max(9.32, 9.32, 5.36) = 9.32 bits, reducing the total security of an address from 160 to 150.68 bits. Given the low stakes involved in being able to create a fake profile with an existing PoH registration video and the fact that no one is likely to be able to crack 150 bits of an Ethereum key for the foreseeable future, this should be an acceptable security compromise.\n\nAt this point, it is worth noting that there is one disadvantage to this proposal: It will no longer be possible to find a person’s profile from the video alone without trying all possible allowed errors, which is to say 639 trials in the worst case. This is easily remedied with a simple software loop, but something to keep in mind.\n\n## Specification\nThe following text will be appended at the end of the first bullet point of subsection 4. of the “List of current required/optional elements and submission rules”:\n```\nA single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n\nAs stated on the effects on security, 1 character does not add a great impact on security, but it does greatly impact on UX and humans registering making honest mistakes. \nIt could be argued that in a future time, we could be allowing more characters mistakes, which would lead to a slippery slope. The key point is to maintain security and adding more characters would have a greater impact on security. 1 character mistakes can be considered as a good balance between honest mistakes while maintaining security.\n\n## Mission Board Ratification\nSince this HIP has been recreated from an existing phase 2, the proposers have asked the Mission Boards to ratify the validity of this HIP. The board's vote on this phase 3 is proof enough that they confirm it's validity. (See https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/special-binding-mission-board-ratification-hip-27/1417)\n",

        "body": "```\nHIP: 27\ntitle: Allow 1-character mistakes in displayed addresses\nauthor: @Mizu @juanu\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2021-11-19\n```\n## Simple Summary\nThis proposal would modify the registry policy to allow for limited mistakes or omissions in the address displayed in a profile’s video.\n\n## Abstract\nMany profiles get challenged due to mistakes affecting a single character in the address displayed by the submitter in their video. This proposal would make it so a single such mistake would no longer be grounds for rejection. This would not reduce the security of the profile or the PoH registry in any practical terms as will be demonstrated below.\nMotivation\n\nSubmitters will often write down their address by hand instead of printing it or displaying it on another screen. This might be because they don’t have a printer or another device with a screen they can easily display it on, or simply because they find writing the address by hand to be more convenient at that time.\n\nAs one might expect, it is often the case that submitters make mistakes when copying their address. Sometimes, these are significant errors such as the omission of a large part of the address, in which case it might be possible for an attacker to generate matching addresses, but often the error will affect only one character. We may distinguish 4 types of errors:\n\n```\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n\nThis proposal would allow at most one of the above three errors in a displayed address. The effects on the security of an address (i.e. on the ability of an attacker to find a private key generating an address which would match the displayed address) would be the following:\n\n```\n- omitted character: 9.32 bits: lg(40*16): 40 positions to insert the missing character which has 16 possible values\n- mistaken character: 9.23 bits: lg(40*15): 40 characters with 15 possible invalid values each\n- swapped adjacent characters: 5.29 bits: lg(39): 39 possible swaps of adjacent characters, although note that this can be slightly lower still since not all swaps have an effect (e.g. in “abbd”, swapping the two \"b\"s has no effect)\n- additional character: 5.36 bits: lg(41): 41 choices for which character to delete\n```\n\nNote that if a character is missing (case 1.) the three other cases are no longer allowed, and conversely, if the displayed address has all 40 characters (case 2. and 3.), the first and fourth cases are no longer allowed, and if there is an extra character, then only case 4. may be considered. As a result the maximum security loss is max(lg(N_1), lg(N_2 + N_3), lg(N_4)) = max(9.32, 9.32, 5.36) = 9.32 bits, reducing the total security of an address from 160 to 150.68 bits. Given the low stakes involved in being able to create a fake profile with an existing PoH registration video and the fact that no one is likely to be able to crack 150 bits of an Ethereum key for the foreseeable future, this should be an acceptable security compromise.\n\nAt this point, it is worth noting that there is one disadvantage to this proposal: It will no longer be possible to find a person’s profile from the video alone without trying all possible allowed errors, which is to say 639 trials in the worst case. This is easily remedied with a simple software loop, but something to keep in mind.\n\n## Specification\nThe following text will be appended at the end of the first bullet point of subsection 4. of the “List of current required/optional elements and submission rules”:\n```\nA single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n--\n- See [Republish motivation](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275#republish-motivation)\n- See [Effects on Security](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275#specification)",

Current phrase states \"...and that I am not already registered in this registry\" which would be false for already registered users. The primary aim for this proposal would be to clearly define what the phrase should be.\n\n# Motivation\nThe renewals beginning in the following month is going to trigger more opportunistic challenges due to lack of clarification of the current text.\n\n# Specification\nAn upgrade to the metadata document should be added which will specify the renewal procedure.\nAdd a section with title \"Elements required for renewal\" and say\n\n> The renewal procedure will follow the same rules than the registry procedure **except:**\n> * The renewer must say <to be defined, see below>. Renewers should speak in their normal voice and should not attempt mimicking someone else’s voice. Speaking before or after the required sentence is acceptable. Poor English accents, mispronunciations, and the switch or oversight of words in that sentence are not grounds for rejections\n> * The sign should display in a readable manner the <time validation options, se below> \n\n## Proposed new phrases in English\n- “I certify that I am a real human and that I am renewing my registration on this registry” by @juanu\n- “I certify that I am a real human and that I am re-applying for this registry” by @Koki\n- \"“I certify that I am a real human, and this is my video for Proof of Humanity.” by @ruben\n\n## Proposed alternatives for time validation\nThe sign should show an ethereum blockhash, which could be \n* the time when the renewer clicked on the \"renew\" button. \n* some periodical reference time in the recent past, for example the midnight UTC of last day, or 00:01:00 UTC of the first day of each month. \n\nThe way that this time validation is generated should be less mistake-prone for the renewer, and easier/faster for the challenger to catch a mismatch. A solution that could prevent long character strings is to shorten the hash into an even shorter hash through some shortening algorithm. Ideally it would consist of 4-6 characters.\n\n---\n# Resumen simple\nAclarar cuál debe ser la frase para la renovación del perfil. \n\n# Resumen\nAhora que ha comenzado el periodo de renovación para algunos, hay algunas cuestiones relacionadas con la frase que debe utilizarse para la renovación. La frase actual dice \"...y que no esté ya inscrito en este registro\" lo cual sería falso para los usuarios ya registrados. El objetivo principal de esta propuesta sería definir claramente cuál debe ser la frase.\n\n# Motivación\nLas renovaciones que comienzan en el mes siguiente van a desencadenar más impugnaciones oportunistas debido a la falta de aclaración del texto actual.\n\n# Especificación\nDebería añadirse una actualización del documento de metadatos que especifique el procedimiento de renovación.\nAñadir una sección con el título \"Elementos necesarios para la renovación\" y decir\n\n> El procedimiento de renovación seguirá las mismas reglas que el procedimiento de registro **excepto:** > El renovador debe decir <a definir, véase más adelante>. Los renovadores deben hablar con su voz normal y no deben intentar imitar la voz de otra persona. Se acepta hablar antes o después de la frase requerida. El acento inglés deficiente, la mala pronunciación y el cambio u omisión de palabras en esa frase no son motivo de rechazo\n> * El cartel debe mostrar de manera legible las <opciones de validación de tiempo, se abajo> \n\n## Nuevas frases propuestas en inglés\n- \"Certifico que soy un humano real y que renuevo mi inscripción en este registro\" por @juanu\n- \"Certifico que soy un humano real y que vuelvo a solicitar mi inscripción en este registro\" por @Koki\n- \"Certifico que soy un humano real y que este es mi vídeo para la Prueba de Humanidad\" por @ruben\n\n## Alternativas propuestas para la validación del tiempo\nEl cartel debería mostrar un blockhash de ethereum, que podría ser \n* la hora en que el renovador hizo clic en el botón \"renovar\". \n* alguna hora de referencia periódica en el pasado reciente, por ejemplo la medianoche UTC del último día, o las 00:01:00 UTC del primer día de cada mes. \n\nLa forma en que se genera esta validación de la hora debería ser menos propensa a errores para el renovador, y más fácil para el retador para detectar un error. Una solución que podría evitar las cadenas de caracteres largas es acortar el hash en un hash aún más corto a través de algún algoritmo de acortamiento. Lo ideal sería que consistiera en 4-6 caracteres\n\n\n",

It should also be displayed on the forum.\nA board member can also post this proposal on the current snapshot page.\nIf the amount of \"Change the board composition and snapshot page\" votes on any of the snapshot page exceeds the amount of \"Make no change\" on both snapshot pages, the proposal changing the board and snapshot page is accepted.\nIn case no proposal is created by a board member within the voting period of the proposal on the new snapshot page and the amount of \"Change the board composition and snapshot page\" exceeds the amount of \"Make no change\", the proposal changing the board and snapshot page is also accepted.\n- In case of proposals/votes being censored by snapshot a similar process can be used to change the voting platform to a new platform (in this case the board composition isn't changed).\n- A Proof Of Humanity polls snapshot page can be created for non enforcing polling.",

        "body": "HIP: 27\ntitle: Allow 1-character mistakes in displayed addresses\nauthor: Mizu\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2021-09-14\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal would modify the registry policy to allow for limited mistakes or omissions in the address displayed in a profile’s video.\n\n## Abstract\n\nMany profiles get challenged due to mistakes affecting a single character in the address displayed by the submitter in their video. This proposal would make it so a single such mistake would no longer be grounds for rejection. This would not reduce the security of the profile or the PoH registry in any practical terms as will be demonstrated below.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSubmitters will often write down their address by hand instead of printing it or displaying it on another screen. This might be because they don’t have a printer or another device with a screen they can easily display it on, or simply because they find writing the address by hand to be more convenient at that time.\n\nAs one might expect, it is often the case that submitters make mistakes when copying their address. Sometimes, these are significant errors such as the omission of a large part of the address, in which case it might be possible for an attacker to generate matching addresses, but often the error will affect only one character. We may distinguish 4 types of errors:\n\n1. omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n2. mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n3. swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”)\n4. additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n\nThis proposal would allow at most one of the above three errors in a displayed address. The effects on the security of an address (i.e. on the ability of an attacker to find a private key generating an address which would match the displayed address) would be the following:\n\n1. omitted character: 9.32 bits: lg(40*16): 40 positions to insert the missing character which has 16 possible values\n2. mistaken character: 9.23 bits: lg(40*15): 40 characters with 15 possible invalid values each\n3. swapped adjacent characters: 5.29 bits: lg(39): 39 possible swaps of adjacent characters, although note that this can be slightly lower still since not all swaps have an effect (e.g. in “abbd”, swapping the two \"b\"s has no effect)\n4. additional character: 5.36 bits: lg(41): 41 choices for which character to delete\n\nNote that if a character is missing (case 1.) the three other cases are no longer allowed, and conversely, if the displayed address has all 40 characters (case 2. and 3.), the first and fourth cases are no longer allowed, and if there is an extra character, then only case 4. may be considered. As a result the maximum security loss is max(lg(N_1), lg(N_2 + N_3), lg(N_4)) = max(9.32, 9.32, 5.36) = 9.32 bits, reducing the total security of an address from 160 to 150.68 bits. Given the low stakes involved in being able to create a fake profile with an existing PoH registration video and the fact that no one is likely to be able to crack 150 bits of an Ethereum key for the foreseeable future, this should be an acceptable security compromise.\n\nAt this point, it is worth noting that there is one disadvantage to this proposal: It will no longer be possible to find a person’s profile from the video alone without trying all possible allowed errors, which is to say 639 trials in the worst case. This is easily remedied with a simple software loop, but something to keep in mind.\n\nIt will also be desirable to make the conventional “0x” prefix explicitly optional too since it does not really serve a purpose and people have occasionally been penalized for omitting it.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following text will be appended at the end of the first bullet point of subsection 4. of the “List of current required/optional elements and submission rules”:\n\n> The displayed address need not contain the prefix “0x”. A single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n> \n> 1. omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n> 2. mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n> 3. swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”)\n> 4. additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)",

The UBI token will have moving forward a specific DAO of its own, where holders of UBI will be able to vote with their stake and thus make decisions that will have influence over the [UBI smart contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd1ad9a21ce722c151a836373babe42c868ce9a4).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn order to increase the demand-side pressure, improving the utility of the UBI token by making it useful for governance decisions that influence its own smart contract shall have a positive impact in price over the long term and incentivize long term accumulation from investors and holders. Governance staking has proven to be an effective influence for long term holding across multiple DeFi projects and from a legitimacy perspective, it makes sense that those with \"skin in the game\" get to advance the interests of UBI token holders.\n\nAlso, taking into consideration that UBI gets airdropped evenly to every verified human on Proof of Humanity, we don't consider this puts at risk the democratic ideals that we pursue as a community. On the contrary: this is aimed at increasing the value of UBI over the long term which shall ultimately benefit every Proof of Humanity member.\n\n## Specification\n\n###  The DAO\n\n1. UBI shall have a Snapshot page of its own where holders of UBI that are verified Proof of Humanity accounts will be able to vote with their holdings of UBI.  \n\n2. A Kleros Governor shall be setup to enforce on-chain the off-chain votes expressed on the UBI DAO.\n\n3. The DAO shall implement a Quadratic Voting scheme where holders will be able to vote with their stake but whales will be mitigated from excessively influencing the outcome of votes since the votes will be computed using the following formula: \n```\n(voting power = sqrt(balance) * isHuman())\n```\n\n4. From the treasury of the Proof of Humanity DAO that originally consisted of 4 million UBI, 50% will be sent to the UBI DAO (2 million UBI). This will not have impact over the ETH or any other assets currently under the custody of the Proof of Humanity DAO.\n\n### Implementation\n\n* The [UBIProxy.sol](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ubi/blob/master/contracts/UBIProxy.sol) smart contract will be used to create the UBIVOTE token as a proxy for the Snapshot page of UBI since it follows the voting formula specified above.\n\n* A Snapshot Page for UBI DAO will be created using the UBIVOTE token.\n\n* A Kleros Governor will be created to enforce on chain decisions made on the UBI DAO — The UBI Governor.\n\n* The UBI token smart contract proxy will be managed by the new UBI Governor created for the UBI DAO.\n\n* 2 million UBI from the [Proof of Humanity DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x327a29fce0a6490e4236240be176daa282eccfdf) will be transfered to the UBI Governor.  \n\n### Additional Notes\n\nLarge holders of UBI that are not verified as Proof of Humanity members won't be able to participate in the DAO. This means that in order to engage with the DAO, UBI holdings must be used directly from a verified Proof of Humanity address. This will help understand the distribution of UBI across multiple accounts and measure the Gini coefficient of the community over the long term. \n\n### We Are United 💪\n\nLast but not least, this is by no means a split of the Proof of Humanity & UBI projects. They both share the same community and must remain connected through the User Interfaces that connect their smart contracts together so current and future users will begin accruing UBI once they finalize their profile.",

Currently, in the first round of Kleros disputes for Proof of Humanity cases, three jurors are drawn to rule on the case. This number of jurors was initially selected to ensure greater stability in rulings and a lower number of appeals while the registry was in its infancy. The deposit that new submitters to the list have to make needs to include enough ETH so that if the submission is ultimately challenged and rejected, the arbitration fees paid to those jurors can be taken from that deposit. Hence, if one starts with initial panels of only a single juror to judge Proof of Humanity cases, this reduces the size of required deposits to submit to the list.\n\nRecall that Kleros is a Schelling point based system and jurors are incentivized based on whether they are coherent with the final juror vote. Hence even when starting with only one juror, there is an incentive for that single juror to vote seriously because there is a potential for appeal. So if people think the juror voted incorrectly, there is likely to be an appeal and the first round juror would be rewarded or penalized based on what the appeal jurors decide. So far Kleros has used first round panels of only a single juror for Linguo (https://linguo.kleros.io/)\n\nThe negatives are that some borderline cases might not be appealed, so there is an added level of variability in terms of whether the first round juror represents how a larger panel would have voted, and that in (the minority of) cases where there is an appeal and you wind up back with a three juror panel anyway, there is an additional delay and some extra gas to have gone through the one juror round.",

The UBI token will have moving forward a specific DAO of its own, where holders of UBI will be able to vote with their stake and thus make decisions that will have influence over the [UBI smart contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd1ad9a21ce722c151a836373babe42c868ce9a4).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn order to increase the demand-side pressure, improving the utility of the UBI token by making it useful for governance decisions that influence its own smart contract shall have a positive impact in price over the long term and incentivize long term accumulation from investors and holders. Governance staking has proven to be an effective influence for long term holding across multiple DeFi projects and from a legitimacy perspective, it makes sense that those with \"skin in the game\" get to advance the interests of UBI token holders.\n\nAlso, taking into consideration that UBI gets airdropped evenly to every verified human on Proof of Humanity, we don't consider this puts at risk the democratic ideals that we pursue as a community. On the contrary: this is aimed at increasing the value of UBI over the long term which shall ultimately benefit every Proof of Humanity member.\n\n## Specification\n\n###  The DAO\n\n1. UBI shall have a Snapshot page of its own where holders of UBI that are verified Proof of Humanity accounts will be able to vote with their holdings of UBI.  \n\n2. A Kleros Governor shall be setup to enforce on-chain the off-chain votes expressed on the UBI DAO.\n\n3. The DAO shall implement a Quadratic Voting scheme where holders will be able to vote with their stake but whales will be mitigated from excessively influencing the outcome of votes since the votes will be computed using the following formula: \n```\n(voting power = sqrt(balance) * isHuman())\n```\n\n4. From the treasury of the Proof of Humanity DAO that originally consisted of 4 million UBI, 50% will be sent to the UBI DAO (2 million UBI). This will not have impact over the ETH or any other assets currently under the custody of the Proof of Humanity DAO.\n\n###  Proof of Humanity as UBI holder\n\nSince the Proof of Humanity DAO will remain as one of the largest holders of UBI, it can vote decisions with its UBI holdings but only after such decision has been voted by the members of the Proof of Humanity DAO first using the PoH Snapshot page. \n\n### Implementation\n\nThe [UBIProxy.sol](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ubi/blob/master/contracts/UBIProxy.sol) smart contract will be used as a proxy for the Snapshot page of UBI since it follows the voting formula specified above.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\nLarge holders of UBI that are not verified as Proof of Humanity members won't be able to participate in the DAO. This means that in order to engage with the DAO, UBI holdings must be used directly from a verified Proof of Humanity address. This will help understand the distribution of UBI across multiple accounts and measure the Gini coefficient of the community over the long term. \n\nLast but not least, this is by no means a split of the Proof of Humanity & UBI projects. They both share the same community and must remain connected through the User Interfaces that connect their smart contracts together so current and future users accrue UBI once they finalize their profile.

        "body": "HIP: 17\ntitle: Reduce Number of Kleros Jurors Drawn in First Rounds of POH Cases to One\nauthor: William George\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2021-07-23\n\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-17-reduce-number-of-kleros-jurors-drawn-in-first-rounds-of-poh-cases-to-one/933\n\nSimple Summary\nThis proposal would adjust the parameter that controls how many Kleros jurors are drawn in the first round of disputes concerning Proof of Humanity registrations/removals.\n\nAbstract\nI propose to reduce the registration deposit by specifying that the initial round of a dispute in case of profile registration (or removal request) challenge only draws one juror instead of three.\n\nThis would be done by updating the following Proof of Humanity parameter.\n\nUse changeArbitrator (specifically changing the _arbitratorExtraData) so that the initial round of a dispute only draws 1 juror.\n\nMotivation\nThe goal here is to reduce the value required for deposits, to the degree that this is securely possible. Currently, in the first round of Kleros disputes for Proof of Humanity cases, three jurors are drawn to rule on the case. This number of jurors was initially selected to ensure greater stability in rulings and a lower number of appeals while the registry was in its infancy. The deposit that new submitters to the list have to make needs to include enough ETH so that if the submission is ultimately challenged and rejected, the arbitration fees paid to those jurors can be taken from that deposit. Hence, if one starts with initial panels of only a single juror to judge Proof of Humanity cases, this reduces the size of required deposits to submit to the list.\n\nRecall that Kleros is a Schelling point based system and jurors are incentivized based on whether they are coherent with the final juror vote. Hence even when starting with only one juror, there is an incentive for that single juror to vote seriously because there is a potential for appeal. So if people think the juror voted incorrectly, there is likely to be an appeal and the first round juror would be rewarded or penalized based on what the appeal jurors decide. So far Kleros has used first round panels of only a single juror for Linguo (https://linguo.kleros.io/)\n\nThe negatives are that some borderline cases might not be appealed, so there is an added level of variability in terms of whether the first round juror represents how a larger panel would have voted, and that in (the minority of) cases where there is an appeal and you wind up back with a three juror panel anyway, there is an additional delay and some extra gas to have gone through the one juror round.",

A 5th member and a tie-breaking vote are also added for the case when the board cannot come to unanimous consent. \n\n**Abstract**\nThe Mission Board needs to function also in the case when decisions are disputed. Therefore we need some simple rules for what happens when there is no consensus. This proposal clarifies what happens in case of dispute, clarifies the limit to the power of the board, and adds two tie-breaking mechanisms - a 5th board member and a tie-breaking vote.\n\n**Motivation**\nA board member contacted me about concerns about the functioning of the board. HIP-7 made the board sound too much like management, and the powers could be interpreted too broadly. In addition, it assumed that the board would function completely without disputes, which was a bit naive. So this proposal seeks to address these issues by adding mechanisms for dispute resolution.

Although they are free to do so, it is not the responsibility of the person holding the admin role to moderate dialogue or content creation, which is a role more commonly known as community manager, moderator, facilitator, etc. An admin may be assigned the role of moderator by the authority responsible for that (Product Manager, Mission Board), but moderators assignment and mechanisms are outside of this HIP.\n2. Community-managed channel: a volunteer status for any of the channels in the Scope of this HIP in which there is an agreement of the channel owner/creator to be associated with PoH. It is accompanied by a badge or a seal or any piece of text that clearly recognizes them as such.\n\n### 2. Scope\n\nRoles for admin positions for each of the Community-Managed channels of communication would be temporary roles and elected from the community. These include (non-exhaustive list):\n\n* Discourse forum\n* Twitter\n* Facebook groups\n* Reddit\n* Discord\n* WhatsApp\n* Instagram\n* Telegram groups, users and channels\n\n### Elections\n\n1. Elections are made separately by platform.\n2. Elections should be done in the Tokenlog platform ([here's the current implementation](https://tokenlog.xyz/Proof-Of-Humanity/proof-of-humanity-web), new repositories will be created on Github solely for the purpose of the Administrator election on each of the platforms).\n3. Elections are ongoing.\n4. Elections are made using quadratic voting (negative votes are allowed).\n5. Each Human will receive 99 voting credits.\n6. Ideally, there should be 1 elected admin for every 500 users in a channel (since the position is voluntary, there might be less than 1 elected admin per 500 users).\n7. The top candidates with a positive score will take their positions (e.g. on a channel with 2.715 members, the top 5 candidates with a positive score will become the official Administrators).\n8. Each time one of the official Administrators lose their position on Tokenlog's ranking, the next candidate to come up in the rank will gain the official role as Administrator.\n9. Admin roles should be registered individuals in Proof of Humanity.\n10. Roles are only revocable for security reasons or serious offenses to the community. The Mission Board can call an emergency voting of 24h in Snapshot. Admins revoked in this way cannot re-apply for the role in the next term.\n11. Admin roles are not moderator roles, therefore do not require to suppress their opinions in debates, as long as they follow the code of conduct established for that channel. Mere opposition to that admin’s opinion should not be grounds for the admin to ban that person.\n\n### Administrators obligations\n\nAdministrators acknowledge that access to communication channels or profiles labelled as “admin” gives them an additional power, which comes with additional responsibilities. They are expected to behave as ambassadors of the project. In addition to following the appropriate codes of conduct:\n\n* They should refrain from expressing virulent opinions about Proof Of Humanity or related projects with their admin accounts.\n* They are subject to higher standards in terms of good conduct (ex: avoiding excessive profanity, or engaging in debates on topics outside of Proof of Humanity, such as politics or religion).\n\nThis doesn’t preclude them from formalizing criticism on Proof Of Humanity. However, it should be done either in (i) a technical and dispassionate manner, and preferably offering constructive solutions, or (ii) using a non-admin account.\n\n### “Community-managed” status implementation\n\n1. The owner of any channel of communication within the scope of this HIP can contact the Mission board and apply for the “Community-managed” status.\n2. A call for volunteers is offered in the channel and those members participate in the election process.\n3. Once that process is finished and the elected members are occupying their roles, that channel receives the “community managed” badge, and a link to that channel will be provided in Proof of Humanity project site, and referenced throughout the rest of the channel's ecosystem.\n4. Failure to comply with any aspect of this HIP would trigger the removal of that channel from the “community managed list”\n\n### Special first condition\n\nFor their significance, and to spearhead the value of having the “Community managed” status, the following channels should enter the admin selection process effective immediately:\n\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity https://t.me/proofhumanity\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity en Español https://t.me/proofofhumanityenespanol\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity Chinese https://t.me/ProofOfHumanityCN\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity Portuguese https://t.me/poh_pt\n* Subreddit Proof of Humanity https://www.reddit.com/r/proofofhumanity\n\n## Rationale\n\nCurrently, the admin positions in communication channels that have grown to the thousands of users, were subject to the initiative of the person that first created the channel, (telegram, reddit). These roles right now are virtually permanent, without rules that govern their time in that position, or how or why their roles were assigned. This creates space for centralization and the possibility of indefinite perpetuation in the position, among other issues that arise from this permanence in their role (silencing opposition, pushing a specific agenda, creating a hostile environment, etc.). Some object that this is not an important role to be considered for election, or that this will lead to voting fatigue. There are enough reasons to believe that this proposal will not lead to this sort of problems.\n\n----\n## Version en Español\nDisponible en este link: https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-16-make-admin-roles-of-communication-platforms-eligible/786",

        "body": "```\nHIP: 18\ntitle: Communication roles\nauthor: @clesaege\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2021-06-17\nconflicts with: HIP-16\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n# English version\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP institutes a mechanism to determine the position of administrator in the social communication tools that are recognized as official by the DAO, either social media (twitter, reddit) or communication channels (telegram groups).\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn order to further decentralize positions of enforcement within the DAO, there is the need to create mechanisms in which the role for administrator of the communication channels **generally regarded as official** (*GRAO*, from now on, defined in the Specification section).\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing the spirit of HIP-5, which creates a framework for management of the DAO without altering the smart contract, I propose a better mechanism for establishing enforcing roles within the all recognized channels of communication.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Definitions\n\n1. Administrative role or admin: the position that a person has over a channel of communication, it being social media accounts, forums, instant messaging groups. In this position, the person has privileges to enforce policies or the convened rules of these channels and include muting, removal or admitting the participation of the members of the group, along with other administrative tasks.\n2. Channel Generally Regarded as Official (GRAO): a volunteer status for any of the channels in the scope of this HIP in which there is an agreement of the channel owner/creator to be acting on behalf of Proof Of Humanity.\n\n### Scope\n\nRoles for admin positions for each of the GRAO channels of communication would be temporary roles and elected from the community. These are for example (non exhaustive list):\n\n* Discord forum\n* Twitter\n* Facebook groups\n* Reddit\n* Discord\n* WhatsApp\n* Instagram\n* Telegram groups, users and channels\n\n### Elections\n\n1. Elections are made separately by platform.\n2. Before any election is held on a platform, the mission board assumes the administrative powers (each board member counting as an administrator).\n3. For platforms controlled by the mission board, 3 members wishing to be candidate can call for an election.\n4. When they do so, there is a 1 week period to let time for other candidates to apply.\n5. Elections are made using quadratic voting (negative votes are allowed). *\n6. Each Human will receive 99 voting credits.\n7. The top 3 candidates with a positive score would be elected.\n8. If there are less than 3 candidates with a positive score, there may be less than 3 admins for this channel.\n9. Admin roles are to be elected for a period of 1 year.\n10. In case the mission board believes some administrator is harming the Proof Of Humanity interest, it can call an emergency 24h vote to remove an administrator.\n\n* Currently we will use tokenlog for those votes. If a dedicated voting system becomes available, the DAO could switch to use it. Note that in the current state of tokenlog the interface may not natively support delegations (either not count delegations or allows both the elector and delegate votes to be counted resulting in a double count), we may initially need to run a script to give the results (accounting for delegations) but if possible a proper interface would be used.\n\n## Administrators obligations\n\nAdministrators acknowledge that access to communication channels or profiled labelled as “admin” give them an additional power which comes with additional responsibilities. They are expected to behave as ambassadors of the project. In addition to following the appropriate codes of conduct:\n\n* They should refrain from expressing virulent opinions about Proof Of Humanity or related projects with their admin accounts.\n* They are subject to higher standards in term of good conduct (ex: avoiding excessive profanity).\n\nThis doesn’t preclude them from formalizing criticism on Proof Of Humanity. However, it should be done either in a purely technical manner, or using a non-admin account.\n\n## Conflict with [HIP-16](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-16-make-admin-roles-of-communication-platforms-eligible/786)\n\nThis proposal is an alternate version of HIP-16 with a few modifications. In case both those proposals were to be accepted, another direct vote (which would not have to go through the classic HIP process) would be required:\n\n> Which HIP should take precedence?\n>\n>\n>\n> * HIP-16\n> * HIP-18\n\n## Delegations\n\nAdministrators can delegate their administrative powers to anyone they see fit. They can remove delegations they made at any time without having to provide any justification.\nIn case an elected administrators disagree on a delegation made by another administrator, the administrators conduct a vote. In case of removal or tied result, the delegate have their delegation removed.\n\n## Rationale\n\nCurrently, the admin positions in communication channels *GRAO*, were subject to the initiative of the person that first created the channel, (telegram, reddit). These roles right now are virtually permanent, without rules that govern their time in that position, or how or why their roles were assigned. This creates space for centralization and the possibility of indefinite perpetuation in the position, among other issues that arise from this permanence in their role (silencing opposition, pushing a specific agenda, creating a hostile environment, etc.). We’ve seen that different admins sometimes have significant divergence of opinion about how channels should be handled and it had led to a few virulent discussions. This proposal establishes a clear and objective way people are added or removed from admin positions.\nThis proposal is mainly taken from HIP-16 but with some changes in the details to make it more practical (allowing delegations, having higher standards for administrator conduct) and to clarify the voting method.",

Definiciones \n1. Rol administrativo o admin: es la posición que una persona tiene sobre un canal de comunicación, siendo cuentas de medios sociales, foros, grupos de mensajería instantánea. En esta posición, la persona tiene privilegios para hacer cumplir las políticas o las reglas convocadas de estos canales e incluyen silenciar, eliminar o admitir la participación de los miembros del grupo, junto con otras tareas administrativas.\n2. Canal Generalmente Considerado como Oficial (GRAO): es un estatus voluntario para cualquiera de los canales en el `Ámbito` de este HIP en el que existe un acuerdo del propietario/creador del canal para ser asociado al PoH. \n### Alcance\n1. Los roles para los puestos de administrador para cada uno de los canales de comunicación de GRAO serían roles temporales y elegidos entre la comunidad. Estos son:\n  * Foro de discordia\n  * Twitter\n  * Grupos de Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Discord\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Instagram\n  * Grupos, usuarios y canales de Telegram\n\n### Elecciones\n1. Los roles de administrador se elegirán durante un período de 6 meses, a partir de la fecha y hora de finalización de la encuesta de Instantánea. \n2. Las elecciones deben realizarse en la plataforma Snapshot.  \n3. Para evitar empates en las decisiones conflictivas dentro del rol, se nombrará un número impar de administradores, idealmente 3 (o 5, dependiendo del tamaño y complejidad de la plataforma): \n   * 2 (o 3) pertenecientes a la mayoría elegida\n   * 1 (o 2) perteneciente a la minoría elegida \n4. Los roles de administrador deben ser personas registradas\n5. Las listas de candidatos deben ser publicadas y fijadas (si están disponibles) en la plataforma respectiva. El período de candidatura comienza 3 semanas antes de la fecha de renovación de los administradores y termina una semana antes de la fecha de renovación.\n6. Por el momento, se podría permitir la reelección para el rol. \n7. Los roles sólo son revocables por razones de seguridad o por ofensas graves a la comunidad. El Consejo de la Misión puede convocar una votación de emergencia de 24 horas en Snapshot. Los administradores revocados de este modo no podrán volver a solicitar el rol en el siguiente mandato. \n8. Los roles de admin no son roles de moderador, por lo tanto no requieren suprimir sus opiniones en los debates, siempre y cuando sigan el código de conducta establecido para ese canal. La mera oposición a la opinión de ese admin no debe ser motivo para que el admin banee a esa persona.\n\n## Justificación\nActualmente, los puestos de admin en los canales de comunicación *GRAO*, estaban sujetos a la iniciativa de la persona que creó primero el canal, (telegram, reddit). Estos roles ahora mismo son prácticamente permanentes, sin reglas que regulen su tiempo en esa posición, o cómo o por qué fueron asignados sus roles. Esto crea un espacio para la centralización y la posibilidad de perpetuarse indefinidamente en el puesto, entre otros problemas que surgen de esta permanencia en su rol (silenciar a la oposición, impulsar una agenda específica, crear un ambiente hostil, etc.). Algunos objetan que este no es un papel importante para ser considerado para la elección, o que esto conducirá a la fatiga del voto. Hay suficientes razones para creer que esta propuesta no dará lugar a este tipo de problemas.\n\nTraducción realizada con la versión gratuita del traductor www.DeepL.com/Translator",

        "body": "https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-7-institute-a-mission-board/424\n\nSummary\nThis proposal is to create a board of members with the responsibility of managing the DAO resources (employees, websites, money) in accordance with democratic decisions. In addition, the current group of people managing the website, snapshot, and forum are designated as an interim board for the duration of 1 year after approval.\n\nAbstract\nFor the DAO to function, it requires trusted members to act as advisors to the management as well as a check on it. This board should handle the access to funds and resources to the management, monitor their performance, and ensure that the technical implementation of voting and other procedures are securely implemented.\n\nThese tasks are naturally already handled by the informal leaders instituted by the creators of the Dao. However, this proposal would give them a formal mandate by the community and put a time limit before the board positions would become individually elected.\n\nSince the DAO does not yet have a robust mechanism for voting the second part of the proposal is that the current members filling this task from Kleros and Democracy.Earth will be formalized as the interim board for the period of 1 year after approval.\n\nMotivation\nAt the moment, the creators of the DAO have control of all resources as a trusted group. However, to have a democratic institution this power needs to be under democratic control. In addition, the employees of the DAO need to be treated consistently by the same group of people to ensure good working conditions.\n\nSpecification\nThe current informal managers, from Kleros and Democracy.Earth are formalized as the “Mission Board” for a period of 1 year after adoption.\nThe initial board: @santisiri, @Herb @clesaege and @federicoast\n\nThereafter elections should be held for the positions on the board before the end of the 1-year interim period.\n\nThe mission board will jointly manage the following:\n\nTechnical implementation of voting\nAccess to critical wallets.\nAccess right to funds by management\nPayment to employees\nAny resource requiring high trust by the community\nIn addition, the board will\n\nAdvise management, administer their payment, and monitor their performance.\nAdjudicate if the proper procedure is followed on passing proposals.\nBe authorized to issue mission statements on behalf of the DAO.\nConflict of interests\n\nA position of the mission board is incompatible with any other paid or elected position in the DAO.\nA board member applying or running for a position in the DAO must first step down from the board before they can be considered.\nA person running for the board can have another paid or elected position in the DAO, while applying or running, but must immediately terminate this position upon entering the board.\nRationale\nThe proposal is meant to improve democratic control but not disrupt current operations. The role of the board is what is already being done by a trusted group or will be done in the near future. But this group would have some difficulty explaining their special role with no democratic mandate.\n\nWe could decide to elect a board immediately, but since we don’t yet have defined voting robust procedures we would run a serious risk of taking a lot of time with this and disrupting the progress on other fronts. This is why the option of elevating the current informal leaders to elected (accept/reject) status but for only 1 year.\n\nBoard members should not be allowed to have or apply for any other position in the DAO. The board is tasked with managing the voting systems and could therefore potentially rig it in their own favor. And the same goes because they manage the resources for management.\n\nImplementation\nNothing really changes, except that elections must be held for the board positions before the year is out. If possible the board members should be marked as such on Discourse.",

        "body": "https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-14-lock-the-1-ubi-hour-person-issuance-rate/626\n\nSimple Summary\nThe proposal is to elevate the issuance rate of 1 $UBI/hour/person to a formal decision and allow no other form of $UBI issuance. Furthermore to lock the decision using the locking mechanism proposed in HIP-10.\n\nAbstract\nThe issuance rate of $UBI is 1 $UBI/hour/person, which seems to be very satisfactory to the community. However, we lack a decision specifying this issuance rate. This proposal formally adopts this issuance rate and bans all other forms of issuance - for instance putting tokens directly into the DAO account. In addition, the decision will be locked using the new HIP-10 mechanism, which will need to pass before this proposal can be put to a final vote. The decision is mostly about sending a signal to ourselves and others that the issuance rate is holy and will not be changed, ever.\n\nMotivation\nA good currency needs dependability - if it operates under rules that are unlikely to change then people will be more likely to trust it. The burning rate question will be left open, but just fixing the issuance rate will already make future supply much easier to predict.\nAnd future problems can be addressed within changing issuance:\n\nIf we need to raise the income, then we but increase the value of the token.\nIf we need money, we but get outside funding or increase revenue.\n\nLocking Motivation\nLocking the decision will send a signal to ourselves and others that $UBI will never be changed. This will deflate arguments against investing time and money in the currency because “the DAO could just put 3 million in its account at any time.”\n\nSpecification\nThe $UBI token will be issued at a rate of 1 $UBI/hour/human.\nNo other issuance of $UBI will be allowed.\n\nRationale\nThis proposal was split off from HIP-10 as a separate proposal because it had too great an impact on the future of the DAO.",

This locking mechanism can either be applied to new or existing decisions.\n\nMotivation\nFor some decisions, we need to signal to the world and ourselves that they are very unlikely to be overturned in the future and that it would require a lot of effort to do so. One such decision would be to, for instance, lock the $UBI issuance rate to ensure that people can forecast the value of the currency, improving stability.\n\nSpecification\nThere would be three ways of creating a locked decision.\n\nIn a new proposal, the decision can be locked immediately. A separate section, “Locking Justification”, arguing why this decision should be locked, must be included.\nFor an existing approved proposal, the decision can be locked by creating a new proposal to lock the earlier decision.\nAn existing locked decision can be put up for a new locking vote to increase the reversal threshold further. This new vote requires a separate proposal.\nTo create a valid locking proposal (cases 1-3):\n\nSome version of the verb “Lock” must be included in the title of the proposal topic.\n\nAll minimum poll voting times are doubled both for phase-2 and phase-3.\n\nIn a phase-3 binding vote the word “Locking” must be prepended for the signal poll along with any other required keyword.\n\nHow locking works:\n\nIn a locking vote, a minimum of 60 % approval is needed, if the approval is less then the proposal fails completely.\n\nIf the locking threshold is exceeded then a reversal threshold is set. The reversal threshold will be the approval rate of the proposal, rounded down to the nearest 5 %. So a proposal passing at 74.5 % would later require a 70 % vote to repeal.\n\nIf the reversal threshold would be set to above 90 % by the above rule then it is instead set to 90 %.\n\nIf locked decisions exist the locking mechanism itself can only be repealed by achieving a majority corresponding to the highest reversal threshold of any locked proposal.\n\nAdditions and exceptions to a locked proposal can only be introduced by other locking proposals with an approval rate higher than the reversal threshold.\n\nRationale\nThis implementation allows the community to make reversing a decision very hard - but not impossible. The difficulty of reversing a decision scales with the amount of agreement at an earlier time. Consideration was also to include a requirement that some quorum of voters must participate in the vote, but this was dropped since this would make the difficulty of reversing a decision too linked to user participation which may vary in unpredictable ways over time. The locking of the issuance rate is postponed, since creating a locking mechanism AND using it on something so central would be too much for one vote.",

        "body": "HIP: 13\ntitle: Adopt a management onboarding procedure\nauthor: @Mads\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2021-05-21\namends: HIP-2\n\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-13-phase-2-adopt-a-management-onboarding-procedure/658\n\nSimple Summary\nThis proposal makes rules for how to hire the management of the DAO, excepting this as a special case of the general hiring procedures.\n\nAbstract\nThe management onboarding procedure suggested here is designed to allow applicants to request the resources they need and describe their plan to finance these resources. They can describe who they need to be hired - filling open positions as well as creating new ones. They can suggest dedicated budgets for specific purposes. They also need to describe how these resources are paid for. The budget and financing plan can be as slim (hire me for PM, we will figure it out later) or as expansive as the proposer desires.\n\nThe procedure also sets a way to decide when we pass on to a decision. We use polls to decide how much time we need to decide/wait for more applications, when the date comes we create a poll to either pass to a decision or extend the application process.\n\nMotivation\nThis proposal is inspired by the applications that the DAO received to the product manager position. Two of the applicant, @paulaberman and @HBesso31, applied to the position with one (@paulaberman- Sofia Cossar) or several (@HBesso31 - Ryan Cwynar/Cami Arias/Anna Kaic) required team members.\n\nThis introduces a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem since the DAO is currently only authorized to hire employees individually (through the HIP-2 1) procedure but the applicants will only agree to be hired if they can have their team along. This proposal allows for the flexibility to accept such applications.\n\nIn addition, this proposal also creates a clear path towards a decision by regularly forcing a vote on whether we should move to a decision. This way we may keep the process open, but still signal to the applicants how close we are to being ready, giving a signal of how likely they are to get a decision.\n\nSpecification\nAmending HIP-2: This process is an exception to HIP-2 because it allows hiring by the onboarding plan. This exception should be added to HIP-2.\n\nApplication:\n\nA new thread is created for management onboarding or an existing one is designated for the purpose.\nA decision/re-evaluation decision is made through a snapshot poll.\nThe re-evaluation poll will be “Are we ready to decide on a PM?”, answers “Yes” or “No - extend 1/2/4/8/16 weeks”.\nIf the answer is No we will use the median value of the poll for the number of weeks for the next re-evaluation date (“Yes” counts as 0).\nIf the answer is “Yes” we will close for further applications.\nIf an application comes in during voting, a full week (from the time of the application) must be available for discussion of the new candidate before moving to the next phase.\nAn application must describe their Onboarding plan:\n\nHow to fill open positions (specific people or the process)\nAlternatively, that which open positions should be closed.\nA budget for operation for at least one year.\nA financing plan for at least one year.\nProposer Selection\n\nA 7-day vote is created with all applicants (their handle in Discourse) in random order. “Which is your preferred PM?” Answers (“Applicant 1”/“Applicant 2”/“Applicant 3”)\nThe applicant with the highest vote count will become the current “Proposer”.\nOnboarding:\n\nThe proposer will create a thread with the final onboarding plan which is allowed to be changed from the original application.\nThe Proposer must within one week create a snapshot poll with the title “[Binding] Onboard [Applicant Name]”.\nThe entire Onboarding plan must be pasted in the snapshot poll.\nOn rejection, the applicant with the next highest vote count becomes the new proposer and the application Onboarding phase is repeated.\nIf all candidates are rejected we reopen for the application phase.\nRationale\nThis process is a compromise between setting a deadline, which will allow candidates to plan their lives and keeping our options open. The candidates know when a re-evaluation occurs, and if we do not close for applications, at least they will get an indication of how close we were to closing and a new date giving them more feedback to plan.\n\nThe poll created by @paulaberman on whether to allow teams came back positive so this process allows for such a proposal. If you don’t like a team proposal, you are free to vote against it and/or vote to extend the application period if only team applications are in.\n\nI considered making the proposal repeal HIP-3, however, this is not needed. HIP-3 simply defines two open positions. If these open positions (not specifying full-/part-time) are incompatible with an applicant’s plan then the applicant must argue why these positions should be closed as part of the Onboarding plan.\n\nImplementation\nAny member can take the actions to advance the process as long as the requirements are fulfilled.",

        "body": "**Simple summary**\nMake clear that the definition of 360p does not literally mean 360 pixels, and that certain codecs crop 4 pixel columns from each side of the image. Submissions with 352 pixels wide should not be considered in violation with submission rules.\n\n**Abstract**\nThis amendment proposal is a fast, immediate solution to issues related to a widespread method of video submission… It moves the minimum dimension of the width or height of videos from 360 to 352 to match what is currently capable in the most widespread technology available. The 8 pixels removed cropped by the codec due to ancient PAL analogue norm is not moving the line too much and it fits the technical capability of current widespread technology. It is not realistic to challenge a person because 8 pixel columns are removed from the side of the picture (in the case that is background that is removed from the frame and not actual image). This amendment is final and it is not intended to serve precedent of moving the minimum any further than this.\n\n**Motivation**\nThe most common and easy way for a lay user to submit and transfer a video without additional installations or knowledge is sending it via WhatsApp and downloading it through WhatsApp web. In order to avoid opportunistic challengers that predate in these submissions, that would otherwise be a good-faith submission, an urgent amendment to this policy should be put in place. It would also lift some artificial and clunky methods that current new users are using that degrades the platform in order to meet the requirements (re-encoding video, padding to sides of it, etc.).\n\n**Specification**\nMinimum video dimensions is a square of 352 pixels by 352 pixels. Videos with equal or higher size than stated should not be considered a violation to the rule #4 of submission guidelines. Videos equaling 351 pixels or lower in size in any of their dimensions will violate rule #4.\n\nThis is an interim resolution until more precise video quality submission guidelines are approved.\n\n**Implementation**\nChange the text of rule number #4, replacing this block of text:\n\n    The video quality should be at least 360p, at most 2 minutes long, and in the video/webm, video/MP4, video/avi or video/mov format.\n\nWith this block of text:\n\n    Video submissions must follow all of the following requirements:\n\n       * at most 2 minutes long,\n       * in the video/webm, video/MP4, video/avi or video/mov format,\n       * vertical (portrait), horizontal (landscape) or square,\n\n    and follow these minimum size requirements:\n\n       * Minimum height: equal to or higher than 352 pixels\n       * Minimum width: equal to or higher than 352 pixels\n\n\n\n**Rationale**\nRefer to [Imprecise rule regarding video quality of submissions ](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/imprecise-rule-regarding-video-quality-of-submissions/443)\n\n**Supplementary information**\nSee also forum discussion in https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-8-phase-3-accept-352-as-minimum-dimension-in-video-submissions/536\n\n[Link a versión en español](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-8-phase-3-accept-352-as-minimum-dimension-in-video-submissions/536/22?u=ludovico)",

Submissions with 352 pixels wide should not be considered in violation with submission rules.\n\nAbstract\nThis amendment proposal is a fast, immediate solution to issues related to a widespread method of video submission. It moves the minimum dimension of the width of vertical videos from 360 to 352 to match what is currently capable in the most widespread technology available. The 8 pixels removed cropped by the codec due to ancient PAL analogue norm is not moving the line too much and it fits the technical capability of current widespread technology. It is not realistic to challenge a person because 8 pixels are removed from the side of the picture (in the case that is background that is removed from the frame and not actual image). It is not intended to move the line any further than that.\n\nMotivation\nThe most common and easy way for a lay user to submit and transfer a video without additional installations or knowledge is sending it via WhatsApp and downloading it through WhatsApp web. In order to avoid opportunistic challengers that predate in these submissions, that would otherwise be a good-faith submission, an urgent ammendment to this policy should be put in place. It would also lift some artificial and clunky methods that current new users are using that degrades the platform in order to meet the requirements (re-encoding video, padding to sides of it, etc.).\n\nSpecification\nIf a vertical video in the proportion 16:9 is submitted vertically, then the 352 pixels of width should not be considered a violation to the rule #4 of submission guidelines, since it is still considered 360p.\n\nRationale\nRefer to Imprecise rule regarding video quality of submissions (https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/imprecise-rule-regarding-video-quality-of-submissions/443)",

        "body": "[Link to HIP-5 proposal thread](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-5-adopt-a-proper-poh-dao-governance-process-to-ensure-hip-quality/393)\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal details a process for creating PoH DAO governance proposals and putting them up to vote.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis proposal provides a detailed structured process for PoH DAO governance proposals. Any individual or entity wishing to create a proposal and put it up to vote will need to go through those steps to ensure that its proposal is detailed enough to be voted on and its implementation enforceable.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe recent proposals on [PoH Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth) confused a lot of people in the PoH community. They lack any detailed description, link to a debate on PoH forum, proper structuring of the proposal and it is not clear if they are only for collecting signalling information or if they will be binding. Moreover, some of them invite people to vote on proposals that may not be technically feasible. This proposal will ensure only proposals and polls with the bare minimum quality will reach the snapshot page and avoid voter fatigue in the process.\n\n### Specification\n\n## PoH DAO Governance Process\n\nThe Proof of Humanity governance process is primarily conducted using the [DAO category](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/c/democracy/7) on the Proof of Humanity Governance Forum. For a proposal to be accepted, it must successfully pass through three phases:\n\n# Phase 1: Ideation\n\nThis phase facilitates an initial, informal discussion on PoH Forum regarding potential proposals to PoH DAO. You can initiate a proposal in Phase 1 by posting your idea in the[ DAO category](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/c/democracy/7) with the phase-1 tag. This phase allows proposals to gather community insight for refinement before opening a formal poll.\n\n**Duration:** Open-ended\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 1 to Phase 2, there is no formal requirement. However, if a Phase 1 proposal discussion fails to garner any momentum from the community, it is unlikely to become a successful proposal.\n\n# Phase 2: Specification\n\nThis phase requires proposals to be posted in a new dedicated thread the [DAO category](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/c/democracy/7) using the Humanity Improvement Proposal (HIP) template. You can create a Humanity Improvement Proposal (HIP) easily by adding the HIP subcategory, after which your draft post will automatically be populated by a HIP template for you to fill in. You can move a proposal to Phase 2 by posting the HIP-# with the phase-2 tag.\n\nThe HIP template recommends that all proposals should contain the following fields when applicable , such as a Simple Summary, Abstract, Motivation and Specification.\nIn addition to these fields, Phase 2 proposals must also include a link to a 5-day long signalling poll on PoH Snapshot page about the proposal outcome (that contains the proposal text as well as a link to the HIP post on the PoH Forum), and it must include the option Make no changes. The Phase 2 proposal poll on Snapshot **should be prefixed by [Signalling]** to differentiate them from binding Phase 3 proposal votes*. In order to be eligible to signal in the poll, community members must be registered in the PoH registry.\n\n>   *In the near future, if we are able to create polls on the forum only open to Discourse accounts linked to a PoH profile, then the signalling poll could be done on the forum.\n\n**Duration:** 3 days\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 2 to Phase 3, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes on the forum poll. If the relative majority of votes on the forum poll indicates the result Make no changes, the proposal will not pass to Phase 3.\n\n# Phase 3: Consensus\n\nThis phase opens proposals to two signalling methods for token holders. You can move a proposal to Phase 3 by editing the HIP post from the previous phase to reflect the snapshot signalling poll result that received a relative majority of votes and by updating the proposal’s tag to phase-3. This serves to refine the proposal for the final phase.\n\nAdditionally, a PoH DAO proposal on Snapshot page must be created (that contains the proposal text as well as a link to the HIP post on the PoH Forum), **it should be prefixed by [Binding]** and it must include the option Make no changes. In order to be eligible to vote for the proposal, community members must be registered in the PoH registry.\n\n**Duration:** 7 days\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to be accepted in this final phase, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes in the Snapshot proposal. If the relative majority of votes on the proposal indicates the result Make no changes, the proposal will not be accepted and considered closed.\n\nAny snapshot proposal not following these guidelines can be considered non-binding.\n\nMany thanks to teams in the ecosystem including Gnosis, Balancer and Uniswap, which inspired this governance process.\n\n# HIP Template\n\n    HIP: <Number to be assigned>\n    title: <HIP title>\n    author: <a list of the author's or authors' name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s),\n    status: Draft\n    created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>\n    requires (*optional): <HIP number(s)>\n    replaces (*optional): <HIP number(s)>\n\n### Simple Summary\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nIf you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough. Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the HIP.\n\n### Abstract\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nA short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.\n\n### Motivation\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nThe motivation is critical for HIPs that want to allocate funding or change the PoH DAO. HIP posts without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.\n\n### Specification\n\n(Required for Phase 2)\n\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for it to be reasoned about by participants in the PoH DAO.\n\n### Rationale\n\n(Recommended for Phase 2)\n\nThe rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.\n\n### Implementation\n\n(If necessary, recommended for Phase 3)",

Candidates submits an initial proposal which contains:\n\n* A resume.\n* A brief writing explaining why they would like to work for the DAO and why they think they would be a great fit.\n* The % of their working time they propose to allocate to the DAO, the requested compensation and its yearly equivalent full time. Ex: 50% for 6 months for a total pay of 25k$ (100k$ of yearly equivalent full time).\n\n2. Candidates have a first interview with volunteers among people already working for the DAO (directly or indirectly).\n3. Volunteers ask candidates to complete one recruiting exercise.\n4. Volunteers indicate privately to the candidate the recommendation they would give to the DAO about the candidate (strong reject, weak reject, neutral, weak accept or strong accept). Candidates can then either allow those to become public or withdraw their application. They also have the possibility to readjust the requested compensation.\n5. Volunteers make those recommendation public.\n6. A recruitment proposal is put to vote.\n\nOnce a worker proposal is accepted, it’s paid monthly for all its duration. In case of under-performance, or budget restriction, the DAO can terminate contracts with a 2 week notice which starts counting from the end of the vote.\nWorkers can stop working within the same notice period but it is advised that they inform the DAO ahead of time and work to find a suitable replacement.\nThe DAO doesn’t monitor worker time, it only cares about productivity and assumes that an equivalent full-time is made of 226 days of work (365 days per year - 2*52 for weekends - 35 for holidays).",

        "body": "Forum discussion: https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-1-ubi-accrual-rate-based-on-vouching-activity/128\n\nThe accrual rate of UBI can be connected to the activity aimed at growing the Proof of Humanity network. Users that are spending gas to vouch for other humans, will be rewarded with more UBI than those that are not contributing to the growth of Proof of Humanity.\n\nTaking into consideration that the current accrual rate is `0.00028 UBI per second` (or `1.00 UBI per hour`), users will be able to earn the full rate if they vouch for at least one human in Proof of Humanity. If a user has never vouched for someone, she can still accrue UBI but at a fraction of the full accrual rate. We suggest to lower the accrual to 1/10th the rate (ie. `0.10 UBI per hour`).\n\n# Development\n\nThe UBI token contract will be upgraded with a new interface to Proof of Humanity that will have the ability to call `getSubmissionInfo` and obtain for a given address if it has vouched or not for someone else using the `hasVouched` boolean value returned by Proof of Humanity. \n\n```\ninterface IProofOfHumanity {\n  function isRegistered(address _submissionID)\n    external\n    view\n    returns (\n      bool registered\n    );\n   function getSubmissionInfo(address _submissionID)\n     external\n     view\n     returns (\n       bool status,\n       uint submissionTime, \n       uint index, \n       bool registered, \n       bool hasVouched, // value used for accrual rate\n       uint numberOfRequests\n     )\n}\n```\n\nThe `getAccruedValue` function  that is called by `balanceOf` will then take into consideration if a given address has vouched or not and set the accrual rate based on this data.\n\n# Considerations\n\nThis will mitigate inflation of the UBI token during its initial phase and reward participants in the network that are effectively contributing to its growth.\n\nUsers that have accrued UBI before this modification will have to transfer their funds to a new address to keep their accrued UBI, or else their accrued UBI so far will be impacted by the new formula if they haven't vouched for anyone yet.\n",
