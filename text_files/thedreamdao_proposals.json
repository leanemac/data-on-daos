Some of these partnerships may involve securing funding.\n    - It’s very important that partnerships are run through the community, because they can affect everything about how a DAO operates. Even a funder that wants to give Dream DAO a check with no strings attached comes with a brand that could negatively affect the brand of Dream DAO.\n    - Additionally, with the establishment of the Partnerships WG is to wind down the Fundraising WG, which we’ve realized does not need a working group (yet). 90% of fundraising is covered by NFT sales and the cofounders of Dream DAO (Josh, Thanasi, and Gary).\n- On the process for engaging and potentially securing a new Dream DAO partner\n    - Member engages with potential organization to discuss potential partnership and terms\n    - Member brings partnership idea back to the DAO into the #partnerships-wg chat on our Dream DAO Discord\n    - Coming out of the forum if it is approved, member creates a proposal with details around:\n        - The potential partner and their mission\n        - The intersection with DreamDAO\n        - What the partnership will entail (what does DreamDAO give / receive and vice versa)\n        - If there is any funding or commitment required\n    - Proposal shall be voted on and approved by voting members of the DreamDAO\n    - If successful, communication will be coordinated and partnership will commence\n\n💚Benefits:\n\n- Gets DAO approval before partnering with other DAOs and organizations\n- Allows for the assessment of risks and due diligence of partnering with other organizations and can help to protect DreamDAO’s reputation\n- Allows for the DAO to understand the potential benefits to the DAO if the partnership is made and any potential use of treasury funds before going to approval\n\n📈Success Metrics:\n\n1.

The program is designed to allow learners to take the often-abstract concepts behind NFTs, DAOs, and social tokens, and apply them in a project/product development framework. \n\nTheir next program is slated to start on May 2, 2022, and will include options for:\n\n- 1-track program that includes just the course curriculum\n- 2-track program that includes courses + a project component\n\nIn exchange for the scholarships, Cypto College has asked if they can include us in their promotional materials and potentially have cross-promotion through hosting Twitter Spaces together, including in each other’s newsletters etc. Promotions may also include highlighting our members as part of their alumni network. \n\n💚**Benefits:** \n\n- Keen and motivated Builders will have access to another path for learning how to use web3 tools in ways that shift for-profit endeavors to align with the goals of public good.\n- Experience working with web2 product development/management natives in transition from web2-web3.\n- Builders who don’t participate in the Explorers program can benefit from this accelerated program to put some of their Dream DAO learning into practice.\n- Increased exposure for Dream DAO, could potentially bring new Champions/Friends to the DAO\n\n🗓️**Duration:** \n\nOngoing partnership, unless terminated by either organization through a subsequent community vote.
