        "title": "Community Guild Season 3 Proposal",
        "body": "## Purpose of the Guild\n\nThe Community Guild is the cultural backbone of the DAO. We onboard new members, facilitate events IRL and URL, connect members to resources, host social clubs, lead dynamic programming, and help people find the projects that best suit their interests, skill-sets, and passions. \n\nBeyond leading onboarding, our guild’s focus will be to curate a lively and fun vibe-aligned culture by hosting IRL and URL events, fostering a collaborative work environment, facilitating connections, and moderating the community and its constantly growing needs. \n\n## Who will serve on the City Council representing the Guild?\nJon Dean\n\n## What are the Guild's goals for the season? What metrics will the Guild track?\n\nThe Community Guild is supporting three quests this season.:\n1. Lead weekly orientation calls and iterate on our onboarding materials\n2. Build a data-driven DEIJ action plan specific to Cabin that can be implemented for Season Four.\n3. Encourage & maintain good discord Hygiene & Cross-Pollination of information & context across guilds\n\nEach quest has an objective with affiliated KRs.\n\n*Objective: Make our onboarding experience world class for DAOs*\n- Build a library of Looms and YouTube videos that form the start of an asynchronous onboarding pathway for introverts.\n- Keep our FAQ and Onboarding documentation up to date.\n- Host 1-3 orientation sessions per week\n\n*Objective: Build a data-driven DEIJ action plan specific to Cabin that can be implemented for Season Four.*\n- Create database and populate it with demographic data of Cabin community, tokenholders, contributors, and city council members\n- Conduct 25 user interviews with diverse stakeholders within Cabin and the DAO ecosystem\n- Synthesize lessons from the user interviews & database to inform three actionable ways to improve Cabin's approach to DEIJ in future seasons\n- Host biweekly calls of a group of Cabin volunteers interested in building out our larger DEIJ strategy\n\n*Objective: Help other guilds retain and engage members while making it very easy for new members to understand the flow of information in Discord*\n- Facilitate weekly meetings at the guild level to unblock members, create a vibe at the guild level, and improve coordination\n- Moderate spam in discord and delete unwelcome messages within 12 hours.\n- Make sure that all intro/help messages are answered by a Cabin member within 12 hours\n- Help maintain a coherent Discord structure that is easy for newbies to understand\n\n\n## Guild Budget\nThe Community Guild is requesting $33,000 USDC and ₡3,315.00 to meet the objectives described above.\nEstimated budget: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u7O8M1OxVb2tRXfezFRo7F84vqoOqmzgcFYDXzxu6tM/edit#gid=1746292086 \n\n## Is admission to the Guild open or closed? How do people join?\nThe Community Guild is as open as it gets! People join by completing the Onboarding Welcome Form, attending an onboarding call, and then onboarding to the guild. We recommend scheduling a time to chat 1on1 with at least two people within the guild to get connected to our current initiatives and quests and see where they can plug in. \n\n## Evaluation of last season\nLast season the Community Guild was born. Through tactical and quick moving iterations, organization, and people-centered stewardship, we established ourselves as the backbone and cultural hub for the DAO. The great thing is that the fun has just begun….\n\n### Three badges we hold on our Season 2 passport: \n- Hosted and Created First Ever Guild Games \n--- A brainchild of the newly formed Community Guild, these week-long games were a fun and competitive way to end our season and look ahead to Season 3. Congrats again to the ~Product Guild~ All we will say is that you are lucky that the Community Guild was unbiasedly moderating the games. \n- Built Onboarding Flow\n---Through the creation and implementation of multiple surveys, calls, and meetings, we onboarded hundreds of people to the DAO. We received over 300 responses on our onboarding Welcome Form and hosted 20 group and individual onboarding calls. \n-Creation of the Guild Liaisons Role\n---Formed out of a need to deepen the second phase of community onboarding, we piloted these roles as a way to take stress off the guild facilitators and have another welcoming smile when you enter the DAO and our guilds.\n\nIn addition to the above quests, we had six KRs\n- Host five IRL event and host seven virtual events separate from weekly community calls, core contributor calls, and campfires.\n---This KR was achieved. In the end, we hosted several dozen virtual events in addition to the requisite IRL events - many of them happening during Guild Games alone. ✅\n- Help 50 new members across the DAO complete a bounty in season two.\n--- It is unknown if this KR was achieved exactly. 188 bounties were completed before the end of S2. It is hard to measure exactly how many people contributed. Our Clarity quest for this season should help make this more clear. ﹖\n- Create and iterate on a centralized onboarding hub complete with links, videos, and other information helpful for folks new to CABIN and web3.\n--- This KR was achieved ✅\n- Create standard operating procedures for hosting onboarding calls.\n--- This KR was achieved ✅\n- Host an end-of-season post-mortem call to determine the best activation, engagement, and retention metrics for future community seasons to track.\n--- This KR was achieved through two routes. We hosted a 360 Feedback process with all of the core contributors and solicited form fill outs from the community. We also started reporting weekly metrics. ✅",

What metrics will the Guild track?\nThe Product Guild is currently supporting four key initiatives:\n1. Growing Guild Membership - increasing the number of contributors/bounty hunters in the Guild\n2. Project Aspen: City as Protocol - The decentralized, on-chain protocol that governs nodes in the Cabin network\n3. Passports - The protocol for citizenship and meaning in Cabin\n4. Blaze - The digital schelling point for DAO operator excellence (the persistent  URL equivalent to DAO Camp)\n\nEach of the above initiatives will take on a high-level objective supported by specific key results.\n\n- Growing Guild Membership ($500 / ₡1,000)\n    - Season 3 Objective: Improve and grow the guild as a place for engineers, designers, and product managers to contribute to the DAO\n    - Key Results:\n        - Publish a formal goal setting and sprint process, likely using Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)\n        - Make product updates transparent and more easily understandable across the DAO. In a survey of 20 DAO members at the end of the season, 15 (75%)  should agree or strongly agree that they understand what the Product Guild is working on. \n        - 50 people are members of the product guild by regularly contributing to products and other initiatives across the DAO\n- City as Protocol ($1,100 / ₡4,000)\n    - Season 3 Objective: Research and Develop a strategy for building a decentralized city protocol\n    - Key Results:\n        - Publish a specification on a protocol for expanding our network of nodes around the world\n        - Deploy 3 prototype TCR implementations\n- Passports ($900 / ₡3,000)\n    - Season 3 Objective: Launch v1 of the product\n    - Key Results:\n        - Conduct 20 user interviews on the product to determine update and improvement priority\n        - Launch 5 features to improve the utility of the product\n        - Issue at least 50 stamps from the different Guilds within Cabin\n- Blaze ($400 / ₡1,500)\n    - Season 3 Objective: Validate the value proposition of Blaze to the Cabin and broader DAO ecosystem\n    - Key Results:\n        - Conduct 20 user interviews to align with users on the job to be done\n        - Test and develop 5 prototypes of new Blaze features\n        - Grow MVP to 50 users contributing 25 links per week\n\n## Guild Budget\n\nThe Product Guild is requesting $22,100.00 and ₡9,980.00 to accomplish the objectives described above.\n\n[Estimated budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZpRI9q1gBvA5HsMOx9B9ADVwBsmWuQ-gUNG_xcoOEnc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Evaluation of last season\n\n✅ Passports\n\nThe goal this past season was to launch and MVP of Passports that would let us mint NFTs. This we did accomplish. While the product isn’t as mature as we set out and we haven’t done as much user testing as we would have liked, it is launched and available to use.\n\n✅ Blaze\n\nThe goal for Blaze this past season was to launch an MVP so that we could start testing the product. This we accomplished.\n\n🛑 Decentralized Product Process\n\nThe goal was to create a process by which anyone could propose a product to the Guild and have it funded. We did make substantial process on this in The Grand Theory of Product but made the decision to stop focusing on this for now. This will either be something we start when we have more traction or this will be something that becomes part of the DAO operating system and so won't need to be part of the Product Guild operating system.\n",

And I want to make a bigger commitment to it.\n\nI would continue my role as Placemaker (40%) and add an additional 3 days per week of work within the Meta Guild (60%).\n\n== Placemaker (existing - 2 days per week) ==\nMy role as the delegate of the Placemaker Guild would continue as is.\n\n== Meta Guild work (new - 3 days per week) ==\n\nMy goal within the Meta Guild will be making Cabin the most effective, joyous, and rewarding DAO in the Web3 ecosystem. This includes a) the DAO attracting, retaining, and getting the best work out of contributors b) the DAO setting an example for how a high-performing decentralized organization can function c) setting up the organization to best serve our mission of building a decentralized city.\n\nThe trad analog might be something along the lines of “COO.”\n\nWhat I’d try to tackle this Season in the Meta Guild:\n1) Discord structure & norms: How do we maintain a joyous and productive Discord filled with juicy warm Cabin vibes?\n2) Compensation: How do people earn in the DAO? How do we get more people making a living independently online? How do we award outsized contributions? How do we evolve the bounty system so that it's a fair and consistent way to earn?\n3) Prepping for the onslaught: What do we do when we have our “Vitalik wrote about us” moment and people come streaming into the Discord? What switch do we need to hit to batten the hatches and have this be a positive rather than negative event within the DAO?\n4) DAO Participation Dashboard: How do we measure whether we are succeeding in being an open, welcoming community that people want to be a part of? How do we measure the funnel of people coming into the Cabin Discord? As part of this, I’d like to build a contribution/engagement analytics system (i.e. people analytics). I’d like to create systems that hold us accountable toward improving these metrics every week/month/year.\n5) Governance thresholds: How do we put the appropriate level of governance against any given decision? What types of decisions should be Snapshot governance proposals? What type of decisions should be less severe? How can people know the difference to empower them to get the right amount of buy-in to move forward? [and how do we allow for legitimate dissent...]\n6) Budget process: How do we assign budget (Cabin + USDC) to the various Guilds or other efforts? How do we give community members tools and voice to hold the budget recipients accountable?\n7) Progressive decentralization: How do we progressively empower Guilds and Sub-Guilds? How do we create an ecology of internal cultures at Cabin?\n\n== Qualifications ==\n\n=Experience within Cabin=\n- Cabin’s first core contributor and Guild delegate.\n- Created and grew the Placemakers Guild, which is central to Cabin’s vision to be an Embassy for DAOs.\n- Designed the existing bounty system within the DAO.\n\n=Experience starting and caretaking decentralized organizations=\n- Have founded three intentional communities (2 purchased, 1 leased) - RGB, Radish, and Duck Cloud.\n- Helped start and grow Preservation Society - a Burning Man camp with over 300 members\n- Write Supernuclear a blog on how to create and manage intentional community\n\n=Experience with the future of cities=\n- Founding team of Culdesac - building the first post-car neighborhood in the US.\n\t- Drove financing, legal structuring, and brand for $170m, 1,000 person ground-up development in Tempe AZ.\n- Advisor/consultant to Kift\n\t- Created the business model and go to market plan for Kift's \"decentralized city\" based on camper vans\n\n== Position length ==\n\nI am requesting this as a 1-year position (Feb 1 2022 - Jan 31 2023) broken up by a 2-month paternity leave (uncompensated) in the May - September timeframe.  (note: This is not meant to be a precedent on leave, others may make different requests).\n\nThere will be a DAO-wide review at 4 months to ensure everyone is satisfied with the arrangement and if there are any adjustments needed. At this point, the DAO could vote to pause the agreement. \n\n=Compensation=\n\nI am requesting 500 Cabin per month direct compensation. I would like to take up to 50% in USDC. \n\nIn addition, I am requesting a time-locked token grant of 750 Cabin per month.  Here’s how the time-locked grant would work: \n- The token grant would vest each month (750 Cabin) that I continue to be in a full-time role with Cabin.\n- This token grant is meant to reflect a role alongside Zakk and Jon in the Meta Guild helping to coordinate the activities of the DAO as a whole.  \n- The tokens would be time-locked and unlock on a rolling basis 2 years after being issued. While they are locked, I can’t transfer them or sell them. The time-locked incentivizes me to create long-term value in the DAO and stay heavily involved. \n- The Meta Guild (with me recused) would decide on behalf of the DAO whether I am still sufficiently active to justify vesting the grant each month. Members of the DAO can share concerns privately with any member of the Meta Guild if they think the grant should not vest based on my contributions.\n",

        "body": "The Community Guild facilitators (Jackson and JonDean) are proposing a budget of 639 ₡ABIN and $750 USDC to scale their ability to facilitate community within the DAO and create a world-class DAO onboarding experience.\n\nThe Community Guild is tackling three core initiatives in Season Two (through Mar 31, 2022)\n\n- Supporting ongoing Community Operations.\n- Building out the Community Onboarding Curriculum and Processes\n- Launching Social Clubs and IRL meetups\nDetails on emerging bounties and tasks can be found on the Clarity Roadmap and most clearly in this excel spreadsheet:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u7O8M1OxVb2tRXfezFRo7F84vqoOqmzgcFYDXzxu6tM/edit#gid=0\n\nThe USDC allocation will cover up to five IRL events as part of the Social Club initiative. Tentative event locations are Los Angeles, New York City, (Miami or SF), Austin, and Toronto. For each IRL event, we are budgeting $150 USDC.  Our goal is to host these events at locations free of cost and allocate the USDC to cover light food and drinks for attendees.  Leftover USDC budget will be reallocated to the ₡ABIN treasury at the end of the season. \n\nIn addition to ₡ABIN reserved for pre-determined bounties earmarked for particular initiatives, we are also asking the community for an additional 300₡ as a discretionary budget controlled by Jackson and Jon Dean. We recognize that emergent strategy is a pillar of past CABIN success and want to have the ability to quickly fund community-related tasks as their need emerges. Leftover CABIN budget will be reallocated to the CABIN treasury at the end of the season. \n\nObjective: Scale the community building team’s ability to facilitate community & connection within the DAO.\n\nKR 1: Host five IRL event and host seven virtual events separate from weekly community calls, core contributor calls, and campfires.\nKR 3: Help 50 new members across the DAO complete a bounty in season two.\nKR 4: Create and iterate on a centralized onboarding hub complete with links, videos, and other information helpful for folks new to CABIN and web3.\nKR 5: Create standard operating procedures for hosting onboarding calls.\nKR 6: Host an end-of-season post-mortem call to determine the best activation, engagement, and retention metrics for future community seasons to track.\nKR 7 (Discord - for social club initiative): Weekly communicators in discord & weekly messages per communicator (as measured by dividing total messages sent / number of weekly communicators)\n",

        "body": "## Summary \n\nWe propose that the DAO mint 1,000,000 ₡ABIN and replace the current CABIN token. If approved, the DAO will distribute up to 21% to existing CABIN holders, swap up to 10% with strategic partners in exchange for $2,500,000 USDC, and hold the remaining portion in the DAO treasury.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe original CABIN token was distributed to serve as a governance mechanism for a 3-month experimental residency program for independent online creators. While this program has been a huge success, the token itself is no longer sufficient for the community that has grown around it. This proposal calls for a new token, ₡ABIN, which will allow us to:\n\n- Establish a larger token supply to account for the increased size of the community\n- Maintain more of the token supply within the DAO treasury to support future contributors\n- Diversify the treasury with stable assets that can be used to compensate community members\n- Allow the DAO to mint more ₡ABIN in the future\n\nOver the past month, we have discussed these goals extensively as a community and have achieved rough consensus  around the following plan. \n\n## Specification\n\nMint 1,000,000 ₡ABIN to replace the existing CABIN token (0x94515e4f6fabad73c8bcdd8cd42f0b5c037e2c49)\n\nDistribute ₡ABIN as follows (all remaining ₡ABIN not accounted for below will remain in the DAO treasury):\n-  Distribute approximately 11% of supply to existing CABIN holders\n\t- Existing holders are eligible to receive 3.2 ₡ABIN for each CABIN held as of the snapshot\n\t- Existing holders who participated in governance will receive an additional 10% compounding multiplier per governance vote as of the snapshot\n- Distribute 10% of supply to founders\n\t- Zakk (zakk.eth) and Jon (hillis.eth) will each receive 50,000 ₡ABIN, subject to vesting conditions\n- Distribute 10% of supply to strategic partners at an implied fully diluted token valuation of $25M \n\t- Execute a treasury diversification by swapping 100,000 ₡ABIN for $2.5M USDC into the DAO treasury\n    - The full list of participants, including dozens of operators from across the DAO ecosystem and community members [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q35NNXJpHsEbQjEsnBdYFxVSv1QyZ0JcKYwqMxlSRHo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\t- The largest participants in this treasury diversification (subject to vesting conditions) are:\n\n| Partner  | Allocation |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Multicoin Capital (Vishal Kankani) | 40,000 ₡  |\n| Awesome People Ventures (Julia Lipton) | 10,000 ₡ |\n| Seed Club Ventures (Nima Asghari) | 10,000 ₡ |\n| IDEO CoLab (Reuben Bramanathan) | 10,000 ₡ |\n| SHL Capital (Sahil Lavingia) | 4,000 ₡ |\n| El Cap (Kunal Tandon) | 4,000 ₡ |\n\n- Vesting conditions\n\t- The supply distributed to existing CABIN holders in exchange for ₡ABIN will not have vesting conditions\n\t- All remaining grants (founder + strategic partner) greater than or equal to 4,000 ₡ will be subject to a vesting period with 50% vested after one year and the remaining 50% vested after the second year from the date of proposal approval\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nThis proposal represents both an important moment for Cabin. It represents the impact we've had through our residency program. It also shows the strength of the community we've built: 42% of the contributors to the treasury diversification were existing DAO members and combined they are contributing 66% of the total funds. The most important thing this proposal represents is what we get to do next: build cool shit.\n\nYour vote is the most important investment that can be made here. It signals your commitment to this next chapter of Cabin. Let's build!\n\n## Vote\n\nHell Yes - Vote Hell Yes to approve the proposal\nNo - Vote No to reject the proposal\n",

The process we'd like to follow is \"straw poll\" voting in Discord: we'll create a proposal as a message here in #governance. if people agree they should give a thumbs up on the proposal. if people don't agree, we have an open a discussion about trade-offs and alternatives. If we don't hear within 24 hours, then we proceed.\n3. Finally, We propose that this budget last until November 5, 2021 (approximately one week after the end of Cohort 3).",

        "body": "We have discussed setting up a Uniswap liquidity pool for $CABIN to allow for more people to join our community.  Given the progress the community has made over the past couple of months, it makes sense for the price to have appreciated from the initial 1 ETH : 1000 CABIN ratio, though there is a question of how much it should have appreciated (e.g., 1 ETH : 100 CABIN = 10x increase, 1 ETH : 500 CABIN = 2x increase).  Of course, the market will bring this to equilibrium once the pool is launched.\n\nAs a first step, we'd propose to use 1 of the 3 ETH from the Treasury for this experiment and an associated amount of CABIN (currently 12k in Treasury).\n\nDo you agree with this plan?  If so, where should we set the initial price?",
