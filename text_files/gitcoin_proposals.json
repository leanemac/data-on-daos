        "body": "Summary\n\nThis proposal, if passed, would issue 50,000 GTC for governance rights equating to 1,500,000 $WONDER tokens (1.5% of total supply) when Wonder’s token is live. \n\nIn addition, upon launch, 1% of Wonder’s treasury will be used for QF rounds via Gitcoin Aqueduct 2, to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder.\n\nThe purpose of this alliance is to solidify the partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder where we can work together to enable DAOs to succeed.\n\nMotivation\n\nGitcoin and Wonder are pursuing aligned missions.\n\nGitcoin’s mission is to build & fund the open web; Wonder is building the necessary tools to facilitate thriving projects on the open web.\n\nWonder’s task management system allows DAOs to intuitively organize projects, pay contributors with their native token, and onboard new members with ease.\n\nGitcoin, a DAO of DAOs, benefits from partnership with projects that provide the infrastructure for a nascent DAO ecosystem. Specifically, Wonder can help Gitcoin-funded projects better onboard and retain contributors, improve productivity, and increase visibility within the DAO. In addition, we see this relationship complementing Gitcoin in the following ways:\n\n- Integrations that help Gitcoin source, fund, and scale more public good projects\n- Collaboration on job fairs, hackathons, and events for DAOs\n- Co-Creating tools to help the Gitcoin DAO operate more efficiently\n- Enabling Gitcoin to have a voice in the future direction of Wonder\n- Overall, this partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder would likely mark the first of many collaborations with projects in the ‘DAO tooling’ space.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe passing of this proposal would transfer 50,000 GTC to 0x231F77F0c4D7a9F2E20767c7B76ae745A6c547f9, Wonder’s specified Treasury address.\n\nOn the launch of Wonder’s token, 1,500,000 $WONDER would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin’s multisig address.\n\nIn addition, upon launch, 1% of Wonder’s treasury will be used for QF rounds via Gitcoin Aqueduct 2, to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder.\n\nUse of Funds\n\nTo ensure long term alignment, Wonder will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2024 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.\n\nTo ensure long term alignment, Gitcoin will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2024 and act as a meta-delegate in the Wonder ecosystem.\n\n1% of Wonder’s treasury will be used for QF rounds via Gitcoin Aqueduct 2, to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder.\n\nBenefits\n\n- A long term collaboration between Gitcoin and Wonder\n- Integrations of Gitcoin on Wonder’s platform\n- 1,500,000 $WONDER tokens\n- 1% of $WONDER treasury would flow back into QF PGF mechanisms\n\nDrawbacks\n\n- 50,000 GTC would be removed from the treasury.\n\nPrior Discussion & Forum Vote\n\nPlease see prior discussion and our forum vote here:\nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-partnership-mutual-grant-with-wonder/10170\n\nVote\n\nVote `For` to support the partnership & mutual grant.

By doing away with specific grant categories and having all grants listed together, we took a step towards simplifying and decentralizing matching. \n\nOn the whole, the Public Goods Funding workstream believes the experiment was a success – directionally, at the very least. We believe the experiment was helpful in getting funding to more grants without complaints from top earners, and allowed us to test our assumptions about removing categories.\n\nA statement from the PGF workstream:\n\nWe don’t know for sure yet if the main pool approach works best long-term, but we do know that there were major benefits for a longer tail of grantees and that it exceeded our expectations despite bugs, and we think it’s worth trying again before we drastically change course.\nVote\n\nVoting\n\nThe forum post outlined three options – to continue with the cap at 2.5%, to continue with the cap at a different percentage (as proposed by the community), or a completely new community-led proposal, should anyone want to put a new structure forth. \nDuring the period the forum post was up, we did not receive any specific proposals for different percentages or structures to try in GR13.\n\nAs a result, we are structuring the vote as follows:\n\nFOR: Repeat main pool with 2.5% cap\n\nStick to exactly what we did in GR12.\n\nNo individual grant’s matching contribution amount shall exceed 2.5% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $30K of the $1.2M pool).\n\n\nAGAINST: Alternate proposal\n\nSelect this option if you have an alternate proposal you would like to table.

Unfortunately, there are several users who were eligible for the drop because they funded the project Force DAO before the cut-off date for the airdrop. However, due to an error in the transaction validator these users were unable to claim their tokens. Specifically, when these users went to claim their tokens within the 30-day airdrop window, they were not allocated a percent of GTC tokens for their donations to Force DAO. After speaking with users and investigating online, it seems that those transactions were incorrectly dropped before the airdrop period. After some of these users reported it, they eventually had their transactions re-added, but after the cut-off date. This proposal is looking to retroactively compensate those users who were not able to claim their GTC due to the error. \n\nWe will compensate the users linked below. All these users have demonstrated the necessary proof to be eligible for the airdrop and were responsive throughout the proposal process. We had two criteria in order to show eligible proof:\n\n1) Proof of original donation which meets the original airdrop requirements\n2) Proof of an attempted claim during the original airdrop period\n\nIf passed, we wish to distribute the specified amount (view linked pdf for exact amounts) through WhalerDAO’s Astro-Drop. The total amount of GTC to be distributed to these users is 32,717.33\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n- List of users: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p5botoxZ4vd5XpVbZzusyiqxZGfB8SaU/view?usp=drivesdk\n\n- Budget breakdown:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1LjNKqpz3iWM5qtXoD58W37ZtDq1ZnETj/view?usp=drivesdk\n\n- Read the full proposal: \nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-redistribute-gtc-to-individuals-who-could-not-claim-due-to-error/8782\n\n- Distribution tool: \nhttps://whalerdao.github.io/astrodrop/create",

        "body": "This Snapshot vote is looking to finalize a decision around the Gitcoin Grants Round 12 allocations proposed and discussed [in this forum post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-gr12-matching-pool-allocations/9007/24).\n\nAbstract\n\nGitcoin has historically utilized categories, based on Grant types, to determine matching pool allocations based on a percentage of the overall matching pool fund during Grant Rounds. During the GR11 Finale Event this overall strategy was questioned by Vitalik Buterin, the argument being Quadratic Funding should be just as effective during Grant Rounds using no categories.\n\nDuring GR12, the Public Goods Funding workstream wants to test Vitalik’s theory that Quadratic Funding should be as effective at allocating funds as allocation via categories. By doing away with specific grant categories and having all grants listed together, we hope to simplify and decentralize matching. This is a radical change in how we’ve historically set matching funds for grants’ matching pools, but a challenge we believe will help to better understand how to best implement Quadratic Funding.\n\n\n[The forum post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-gr12-matching-pool-allocations/9007/24) outlines the above in more detail –- and this Snapshot vote will decide if and how we test this approach in GR12.\n\nVote\n\nThe three options to vote on are:\n\nOption 1: Single Pool Experiment\n\nUse GR12 as a test case to run an experiment whereby we do away with categories.\n\nThe GR12 main pool will be a single matching pool fund/distribution of $1,000,000 in matching for the round. No individual grant’s matching contribution amount shall exceed 2.5% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $25k)\n\nPros: We get to run a proper experiment and try out a new approach to funding\n\nCons: The experiment is an unknown vs. our tried & trusted categories\n\n\nOption 2: No experiment\n\nStick with the same category-based approach we’ve been using in the past – specifically, run GR12 with the same categories as GR11.\n\nPros: Less uncertainty (rinse & repeat prior round approach)\nCons: We remain in the dark as to how a Single Pool might perform\n\n \nOption 3: Do a 50/50\n\nRun 50% of the matching pot as a single pool experiment, and 50% category-based as before.\n\nThis option was proposed in response to the governance proposal that outlined Option 1. This was proposed as a ‘happy medium’ – going more gradually vs. doing a full-on experiment in GR12.\n\nPros: We get to experiment a bit while maintaining the category approach for half the pool\nCons: Having both at once is more complex and potentially very confusing for grantees",

This proposal issues them a grant, which solves for the near term the funding of CLR.Fund.\n\nSecondarily, this proposal if passed would\n\n- Extend [previous friendly contact](https://twitter.com/nanexcool/status/1383481998417678342) between Kevin Owocki and Auryn MacMillian to formally affirm that Gitcoin & CLRFund are friendly projects built around similar missions.\n- Change the narrative created by other competitive projects working on the same domain. That is the misguided belief that we must have sharp elbows - boxing each other out from each other’s users and demonstrate loud social media clap-backs.\n- It is possible that the goodwill between the two projects could be extended into a formal integration or partnership one day - especially with the [Decentralize Gitcoin workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-decentralize-gitcoin/180) gaining speed.\n- By pushing new tech and solutions on top of QF (such as MACI), CLR.Fund can act as a testbed/testnet for future gitcoin features and visa-versa.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nThis proposal met the minimum number of days for deliberation having been posted on August 15.\n\nRead the full proposal details and the discussion here: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240",

Especially science and software libraries public goods suffer severe underfunding when funding quadratic, because every funder cannot know every science topic.\n\n* When doing quadratic funding it inevitably goes much random - some projects are funded too much and some are severely underfunded (among other reasons, because well-funded projects can buy SEO of their ads).\n\n* Anti-sybil is improving but it can’t be perfect.\n\n* If some important text or software is buried on the 100000th position of Google, the world gets stuck: nobody knows that the missing component is a problem and therefore nobody fixes the problem.\n\nSo, we need a much more objective mean of funding. Ideally funding amount should be calculated by an algorithm, not by stupid us.\n\nWe don’t yet have an algorithm capable to predict the future of the human work. The solution is to use a prediction market to predict a future algorithm results. So the market decides.\n\nTraders (when motivated by money) are much more careful, hard working, and through than some random quadratic voter. Traders are therefore multitudinous that much reduces randomness and bias.

That’s important.\n\nIt should be in addition to quadratic Grants. Users should have choice where to pay.\n\nThis software is almost fully implemented (and there is a little outdated pull request to integrate it into a GitCoin page).\n\nThe proposal:\n\n* Pay for quality audit of the smart contracts.\n* Assign me to finish integrating it into GitCoin site.\n* Do a good design.\n* Deploy on production.\n\nHere is the PR and more details:\n* https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/8183\n* https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/pull/8265",

        "body": "This proposal came too late to be one of the options in the [Akita, a path forward](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmUoBpLsMSZ7Aq1UEzvEyGyTdR8Reeb8qQFGUhcQLqcQMM) poll, which at the moment is leading with \"Sell 10%, stream 90%\" and \"Liquidate 100%\" so I will propose it as a further discussion on the merits of how to implement it. This was posted on June 1st as a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/avsa/status/1399892313007083522?s=21) and gathered some positive feedback from many of the community representatives.\n\n## The issue with the two main proposals\n\n* There's not enough market depth to liquidate all Akita tokens without losing a lot of value for Gitcoin. Even if there are serious doubts about the long term viability of the Akita community, we have a responsibility to maximize the value gained for Gitcoin. \n* Locking Akita on Sablier doesn't put that capital to good use, and if the market crashes and recovers and crashes again during before the stream is over, then there was a missed opportunity.\n\n\n## The Proposed Implementation\n\n1) Sell 10% of Akita in any exchange, put it in the Gitcoin treasury\n2) Sell yet another 10% into ETH. \n3) Create a Scheduled Balancer pool with the 10% ETH obtained in step 2 and all the remaining Akita.\n4) Set up the pool controller to programmatically change the ratio over a period P so that it inverts from a 10% ETH 90% AKITA into a 90% ETH and 10% AKITA\n5) After period is over, the community can decide what to do with the remaining tokens. \n\nThose types of pools are usually called **Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools** and are often used to launch new tokens that don't have liquidity. In this case, the token has launched but it would still bootstrap the liquidity. You can read more about LBPs on this article about [Radicle](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/radicles-new-record-lbp-sale-shows-that-lbps-are-here-to-stay-4c81e15a4d4d).\n\nTo make sure the market doesn't dump immediately, we could do step 1 and 2 using [Gnosis Auctions](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosis-auction-launch-390124d56248): this would take off some buy pressure immediately and then make sure the starting price of the LBP is closer to what other market makers have.\n\n\n## The end result is that:\n* At the end of the period, Gitcoin will have sold most of their Akita, at a fairer market price, similarly to a Dollar Cost Averaging strategy\n* Akita community gets a much more liquid market, a \"billion\" dollars deep (emphasis on the air quotes). This will reduce the impact any single seller can have on the final price.\n* All trades that are executed against this pool will earn fees for Gitcoin, so in periods of high volatility Gitcoin is leveraging its massive Akita Holdings to generate Yield\n* There will be a constant sell pressure on Akita, but it's one that is scheduled and known\n\n\n## Variants and Risks\n\nBalancer Pools are quite flexible and we could do other options like having a pool that starts at 91% Akita, 3% GTC, 3% ETH and 3% DAI. Or we could add all the dog tokens into a big billion dollar pile of dog ~~poo~~ money.\n\nPools also don't necessarily need to be locked: we can add a smart controller so that Gitcoin DAO can accelerate the schedule at a later vote, or simply change it completely and use the [Pie DAO](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-pie-smart-pools-85a77a2dc22e) so that ratios can be changed at the will of GTC holders. Also, at any point, Gitcoin could vote to take the liquidity out of its own pool and receive it in either token of the pool.\n\nIt's also important to note that **LBPs are different than just selling a token**: the pool wants to keep a constant ratio at all times to reach its target, be it 10%, 25% or 90%. So it means that *the pool will both sell and buy akita for ETH* to keep the target ratio–that's how AMMs work. A LBP changes that target ratio slowly over time, but it also is reacting to the market in real time. It means that, if akita drops to near 0, then the pool will automatically be buying akita with ETH until it reaches the desired balance, so almost ETH would be drained from the pool. But that ETH came from the Akita sale in the step 2, and the end result would be the same if the strategy was to stream or liquidate it anyway. On the other hand, if the market goes up again, that will mean the pool will start selling the cheap akita it bought back to ETH (plus the fees it got during the period) which is why pools make money from volatility. \n\nDisclaimer: I work for Balancer labs, but if the community wants to they can use other solutions. Balancer also has a \"LBP referral program\" but I am perfectly willing to either not claim it or to donate the BAL gained to Gitcoin.\n\n## Period P\n\nThis proposal leaves the P period open. The ending date of this poll is after the resolution of the [\"Akita - a path forward\" poll](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmUoBpLsMSZ7Aq1UEzvEyGyTdR8Reeb8qQFGUhcQLqcQMM), so votes should take the result of the other snapshot in consideration.\n\n1) Stream: a LBP of duration of 2 years\n2) Intermediary: make the LBP last 1 year\n3) Liquidation: a short LBP over 1 week\n4) Do an LBP but in [another configuration](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-akita-liquidate-akita-for-eth/4255) or platform\n5) No LBP: just lock it Sablier or dump it all in uniswap, depending on the results of the Akita poll\n\n",

This is because there have not been standards and processes put in place as of yet that establish \"what occurs in scenario X if Y\", i.e. \"what occurs when two contradictory votes pass, prior to execution of the first?\" (double jeopardy, to some extent).\n\n# Proposal\nThis proposal is rather meta. It is a proposal to begin a set of proposals to set standards and processes that proposers must follow to ensure validity and enforce-ability. We should set rules for issues such as:\n- Double Jeopardy\n- Proposal Parameter Validity (start time, end time, start block, etc)\n- Proposal Process Validity (template, forum -> snapshot -> onchain?)\n- etc.\n\n# Prior Art\nYam was the first to establish a number of rules that we can look at for how to potentially impose standards for off-chain voting. Many protocols have followed since (some better than others). Yam established rules for what is considered a valid off-chain vote, specifying:\n1. Start date: must always be in the future, and have some amount of time (t+6hrs) from creation of the vote\n2. End date: must run for x amount of time\n3. Start block: must be within x minutes of vote start time\n\nAny vote that does not meet said criteria would be considered invalid and potentially censored from snapshot by controllers of the associated ENS. What I like about the above benchmarks for standards is that in general, most spammers won't follow the above and can be weeded out quickly and easily as well as ensuring fairness/time to prepare for votes, killing two birds with one stone.\n",
