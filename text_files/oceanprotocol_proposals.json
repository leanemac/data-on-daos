Currently Ocean’s compute-to-data uses an architecture that involves kubernetes clusters where a visiting docker container contains the machine learning algorithm and kubernetes configurations allowing it access to (portions) of the data. A new method has to be devised for SSI Wallets as they are typically running on mobile phones which do not allow for apps to run kubernetes server clusters in a usable fashion.\n\nGrant Deliverable 2:\nCreate a knowledge base with the precise definition of Compute-To-SSI, it’s purpose, architecture (including diagrams) and the way to create software using it. This will be set up as a public git repository and will track further progress of the project as well as allow anyone to participate/contribute.\n\nGrant Deliverable 3:\nModel how SSI wallets would interact with the Ocean Protocol ecosystem, i.e. rent existing machine learning models, how to pay for it, or be paid for it. This will naturally be added to the knowledge base.\n\nGrant Deliverable 4:\nModel how an interested party can utilize the network of SSI wallets to train their machine learning algorithm for a specific purpose. Define what taxonomies are required.

A feature of Videowiki is Videowiki Classroom, which creates an interactive classroom environment for teacher-student interaction. This live classroom can be streamed for everyone to consume but there is a lack of a decentralized ticketing system. \n\nGiven our previous implementation of OCEAN Protocol for publishing video based content it will be an unifying experience if OCEAN Protocol is used for streaming services as well. On the side of OCEAN Protocol this will act as an new implementation which can be explored further for more efficient user experience.\n\nThe possibility of using OCEAN Protocol for ed-tech solutions like Videowiki, makes it not only a protocol for Data but also for knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n## Full Proposal\nhttps://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/proposal-casting-videowiki-a-casting-platform-using-ocean-for-ticketing/658\n\n## Grant Deliverables\n- We will be investing this grant for researching various streaming protocols and finding out which is the best for associating with OCEAN Protocol. \n- Develop a PoC based on our research and implement on our platform primarily on the Rinkeybi Testnet\n- Build UI around the integration\n- Optimize the system\n- Publish required documentation and medium articles to spread awareness about the integration procedure\n\n\n\n### Engage in community conversation, questions and feedback\nhttps://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/776848812534398986\n\n## Cast your vote below!",

All scripts and examples as well as course notes will be provided in advance of the course.\nPart I of the course will focus on R via RStudio and the tidyverse framework.\nPart II of the course will be demonstrated in Python.\n**We will publish the datasets required in the course to the Ocean marketplace, and provide datatoken/mOCEAN airdrops, to enable participants to gain hands-on experience interacting with Web3.0 technologies.**\n**On completion of the course, the participants will have obtained a substantial understanding of data preparation and feature extraction methods and will have been introduced to kernel learning concepts. In addition, participants will be in a position to recognize a broad range of supervised learning problems and address them under the common framework of Generalized Eigenvalue problems.**\nFurthermore, course participants will have acquired a solid knowledge of how to curate text data collections in such a way as to maintain the important information whilst removing information noise. They will be able to understand the sources of noise in text data and the risks involved if they are not addressed. Consequently, participants will be equipped with the basic knowledge to begin working confidently on any text processing application and be able to prepare their data for basic feature extraction (e.g. Bag-of-Words) and statistical modelling.\nGenerally, the level of the course will tend to focus on methodology and providing an introduction for participants to concepts and statistical modelling approaches in the topics mentioned above. Proofs of concepts discussed will be referenced in the slides for participants to follow up afterwards should they wish to explore more technical details.\n\n\n### Engage in community conversation, questions and feedback\nhttps://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/776848812534398986\n\n## Cast your vote below!",
