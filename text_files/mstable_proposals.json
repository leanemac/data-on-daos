The buy-back does a mAsset redeem to a bAsset and then a Uniswap V3 swap to the rewards token, eg MTA.\n\nAdditionally, a change is proposed to the contract that allows to have the min amount as a parameter, rather than saving in storage, to allow for more versatile swaps with lower slippage.\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: [Overhauling the Governance Fee Flow](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-overhauling-the-governance-fee-flow/793)\n- Proposal: [MCCP 20: Overhaul the Governance Fee Flow](https://mips.mstable.org/MCCP/mccp-20.html)\n- Discussion: [MCCP 20: Overhaul the Governance Fee Flow](https://forum.mstable.org/t/mccp-20-overhaul-the-governance-fee-flow/840)\n\n**Should the Governance Fee Flow be overhauled as proposed in MCCP 20?**",

This will put the ProtocolDAO and the TreasuryDAO into a position of executing directly on behalf of Meta\nGovernors.\n\nThis proposed structure would not only decentralise mStable further but also pave the way for a completely autonomous protocol in the future. It ensures that all community members have the same right to voice their opinion over proposals and that no proposed changes just appear in front of them without any flexibility to act on their side.\n\n**Should the updated proposal workflow be enacted and followed for future proposals?**",

This [is changing 1](https://twitter.com/VotiumProtocol/status/1447537117165506561) and is likely to get more saturated in the coming weeks, so capitalising asap is important.\n\nShould the parameter set seem to be operating poorly during this period, resulting in a net negative revenue for SAVE (i.e. mUSD TVL goes below $60m), the `savingsRate` will be updated with a relative amount, between 10% (existing) and 50% (proposed).\n\nStart date will be immediately following successful resolution of this proposal, and **last for 6 weeks**, after which time the settings will be reverted.",

The Cat Herder will also be responsible for assuring that all on-chain activities related to these asset management activities will be executed in due time and with proper diligence to maximize the potential of said assets, and one signer from the subDAO will be chosen to liaise with the Cat Herder to handle transactions.\n\nAs an initial funding request, it is proposed to move the **entire allocation of BAL tokens** (ca 13,210) & **DAI tokens** (ca. 422k) from the mStableDAO treasury into this new Safe in order to deploy liquidity on the [Balancer Finance](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) incentivized pools, as well as the [Convex Finance](https://www.convexfinance.com/stake) platform.

This step is done to streamline the process and strike a solid balance between decentralization and tempo for ratifying regular expenses, along with funding of relevant entities, DAOs and core contributors to the mStable ecosystem.\n\nThe Funding subDAO committee will consist of 3 signers from the mStableDAO, and be a 2/3 multisig. A new Gnosis Safe will be deployed for this subDAO, and all funding requests from the ecosystem will be handled by this committee going forward.\n\n```jsx\nmStableDAO Funding SubDAO\n\nSigner 1 - 0x021c1a1cE318E7B4545f6280b248062592B71706\nSigner 2 - 0x8092923e19c86965733BD6F3fE6C13F549C3Bf44\nSigner 3 - 0xd576E7A3D3791C3BcF907eeDe72B2a500a8f54D5\n\nGnosis Safe - 0xfcF455d6Eb48b3289a712c0b3bC3C7Ee0b0ee4C6\n```\n\nFunding the subDAO will be handled in the monthly mStableDAO signer calls as required. \n\nThe current Cat Herder will provide a short summary of activities for the Funding subDAO in each signer call, so the wider mStableDAO signer group can stay up-to-date on the committee. The Cat Herder will also be responsible for assuring that all streams, balances, and upcoming payments will be handled in a timely and precise manner, and one signer from the subDAO will be chosen to liaise with the Cat Herder to handle transactions.\n\nIn line with the request in [this forum post](https://forum.mstable.org/t/future-funding-of-mstable/543) by the Genesis Team, the first action item will be to fund this newly created subDAO with **2.08m mUSD** from the treasury in order to fund mStable  development for the next 12 months.\n\n**Funding breakdown and destinations**\n\n**[Scarcejim](https://forum.mstable.org/u/scarcejim/summary)** as head of operations and project co-lead has calculated a projected burn rate for the next 12 months of mStable’s operations with a fully built out team that factors for:\n\n- New hires across engineering, BD, Marketing, Community Management, and DAO operations\n- Salaries in line with DeFi market expectations to retain talent\n- Funding set aside for future security audits\n- A “buffer” to manage uncertainty for the next 12 months of funding.\n\nIn total, the projected annual burn rate is approximately **2.08m USD**, with the vast majority of this going toward salaries, and includes buffers for unforeseen expenses. Broken down, this includes:\n\n- Current contributor salaries - 997,000 USD\n- Budget for future hires - 610,000 USD\n- Office space, legal, accounting, other operational expenses via operational entities - 274,600 USD\n- Security audits - 200,000 USD\n\n**Funding request broken down by area of responsibility**\n\n![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/mstable/original/1X/56ab3f40b7521829730b209ea052d3565997a31d.png](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/mstable/original/1X/56ab3f40b7521829730b209ea052d3565997a31d.png)\n\n**Funding request broken down by current vs. future hires**\n\n![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/mstable/original/1X/6c0416d12bb55dfdc81dd90ba64e4a4637e01ece.png](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/mstable/original/1X/6c0416d12bb55dfdc81dd90ba64e4a4637e01ece.png)\n\nShould this funding request be granted, there will be a commitment to retrospective quarterly transparency reporting so that all stakeholders in the mStable ecosystem can scrutinise how funding is spent and allocated by core contributors. \n\nShould this request be approved and the subDAO be funded, funds will distributed between three destinations:\n\n- **D44 Ventures UG,** a Berlin-based software development company founded by three mStable core contributors. It is currently contributing to mStable’s core development. The entity hires software engineers and soon will be hiring business development professionals to help scale mStable. Importantly, D44 doesn’t own these areas but rather is a core contributor to them. More granular information about D44’s function can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/3e38054d42c943b48590895dcd91e874).\n- **Barnem Ltd,** an operational and services company. It is responsible for handling mStable’s fiat operating expenses, fiat invoicing, organising core contributor work processes, and assisting with community growth and culture. More granular information about Barnem’s function can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/3b03167468e149bb90901bc1899c3005).\n- **Directly to core contributors** via Sablier stream. Core contributors have been given the option to opt-into receiving their compensation directly via Sablier stream from the DAO. Those who opt into receiving a stream will not be compensated for their work from either entity listed above.\n\n*Please note that this proposal supersede the USD funding request for the Swiss-based mStable Association, approved [here](https://snapshot.org/#/mstable/proposal/QmTH4vnUapkeQncep8yK5iLnGuufGF9Km8bgKibBEsS1mm). This is because the non-action letter from FINMA has not yet been approved, meaning it is not able to fund contributors through grants from the Association as of yet. Given this, and the need to continue to fund mStable’s development, we are proposing that the Association’s funding would need to be subject to another Meta vote following the possible FINMA non-action letter should Meta Governors and the community feel it is necessary. The above structure is designed to be effective without the mStable Association.*\n\n**Should the mStableDAO Funding subDAO be created, and be funded with 2.08m mUSD from the treasury in order to continue to fund the development of mStable over the next 12 months?**",

This change will add further responsibilities and an increased compensation to the role, with a brief summary of the key facts given below:\n\n**Start date** - July 1st, 2021\n\n**Compensation** - 2500 mUSD & an additional 2k USD monthly paid in MTA, calculated from the 30 days VWAP of the previous month. This will be paid on the 10th of every month (or the closest workday following if the 10th falls on a weekend or holiday) from the mStable Fund Manager wallet which in turn receives the funds from the mStableDAO treasury\n\nBoth cat herders voluntarily commit to locking all MTA rewards received in the mStable staking contract for at least 12 months from the commencement of this new and upgraded contract, including the migration from the legacy v1 contract to the new v2 contract in September. This means that all MTA rewards can be redeemed at the earliest on the **1st of July 2022**.\n\n**Roles and responsibilities**\n\n- c.8hrs per day, 3 times per week allocated toward making sure the mStableDAOs and ProtocolDAOs governance processes run smoothly. This includes:\n- Maintenance of open communication threads on public channels such as the forum and Discord\n- Organising and conducting DAO signer calls and maintaining curated records of these meetings\n- Making sure DAO signers reach quorum to execute transactions in a timely manner\n- Managing proposal workflows to ensure they are voted on and discussed when they need to be\n- Writing & posting on the snapshot pages as a comms representative for the DAO\n- Compile and consolidate internal signer feedback in regards to the respective DAO\n- Calibrate between the different DAOs of the mStable ecosystem to ensure smooth day-to-day operations\n- Maintain and continue building out the respective internal Notion page for the respective DAO\n- Acting as a liaison between the wider mStable community and it's Community Manager (Lord of the Discord) and the respective DAOs\n\n**Independence from the mStable Genesis team & small print** - This role is performed for the mStableDAO and ProtocolDAO respectively on the behalf of the mStable Community and all stakeholders. \n\nAll proposals, messages, decisions, and other legally and otherwise binding actions that originate from the respective Cat Herders are done exclusively on behalf of the respective DAOs and mStable community as a whole and do in no way reflect the opinions or wishes of the persons acting in this role.\n\n**Next Steps** - If successful, both Cat Herders will commence work in the upgraded role as described above and continue in this role until the proposal for a full-time position resolves, which will not happen later than the **1st of September 2021**. This intermediate step is present to ensure that the increased workloads are ramping up slowly and gradually, and that both Cat Herders have adequate time to adjust and accommodate themselves with the new responsibilities prior to the full-time commitment.\n\nSince this proposal marks a financial gain for both Cat Herders, they will abstain with both their personal and public wallets on this proposal.\n\nThe option with the most votes will be executed, even if it doesn't reach an absolute majority.\n\n**Should dimsome and mZeroNine have their contracts upgraded to the above mentioned half-time role as Cat Herders and provide them with the compensation and additional workloads outlined?**",

This pool is incentivised with CRV through the LiquidityGauge (currently offering ~20% APY).\n\nThis pool will act as a major source of trading volume for mUSD given that it benefits from [StableSwap](https://www.curve.fi/stableswap-paper.pdf) [PDF] design and the existing liquidity in the 3pool.\n\nWhile the popular vote of the previous poll (50.4%) was in favour of assigning rewards, this was diluted due to having multiple 'yes' options while the main concerns from 'no' voters being further dilution of MTA, with some confusion over where the MTA would be allocated from. An ideal voting process would have first been a yes/no, followed by a proposal on where (if anywhere) this allocation should come from, and in what quantity.\n\nAfter discussions in mStable's Discord server, Telegram group and forum, it is proposed to add 10,000 MTA to Curve's mUSD/3pool Metapool. \n\nA second, separate poll is available for those who agree with this proposal to determine from where the 10,000 MTA is derived.\n\n**Should 10K MTA be allocated to Curve's mUSD/3pool Metapool?**",

Arguments for EARN pools emphasised using the MTA as a mechanism to drive mUSD liquidity (specifically in the WETH or USDC pool).
